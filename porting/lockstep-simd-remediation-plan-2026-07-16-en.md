# Lockstep SIMD Remediation Plan

Date: 2026-07-16

Status: implementation in progress; Steps 0-1 completed, Steps 2-4 pending

Scope: checked signal-level vector mode, lockstep event certification, FIR state lowering, and C++ SIMD evidence

## 1. Decision

Keep the existing lockstep legality analysis, bundle certificate, scheduler
unit, and planar external ABI. Improve the implementation at two lower
boundaries:

1. represent repeated lockstep event-order evidence compactly so the default
   `-vs 32` path does not fall back merely because a finite checker table
   crosses its implementation-size limit;
2. lower delay-one lockstep recursion as register-carried lane state instead of
   four independent chunk-history arrays, preserving the scalar IEEE operation
   sequence while exposing a profitable SLP shape to C/C++ optimizers.

The native SIMD gate must first prove that checked vector FIR was retained. A
`-vec` request followed by scalar fallback is not lockstep evidence, even if the
fallback C++ happens to be SLP-vectorized.

## 2. Audit result and corrected baseline

The original `lockstep-simd-check` introduced by commit `111198ba` compiled the
requested vector mode directly to C++ and inspected optimized LLVM IR. It did
not inspect `FirCompileOutput::vector_pipeline_status` before code generation.
That omission allowed scalar fallback to satisfy the SIMD assertion.

For `tests/corpus/vector_lockstep_simd_quad.dsp`, the observed baseline is:

| Request | Effective mode | Generated shape | Four-wide LLVM FP operations |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `-vec -lv 1` (default `-vs 32`) | scalar fallback: `EventCertificate` | byte-identical to scalar C++ | 14 |
| `-vec -vs 24 -lv 1` | checked vector FIR | chunk driver plus four `vstate_*_tmp` histories | 0 |

The default-size fallback reports:

```text
bounded event model needs 4243 events, limit is 4096
```

This does not reject the DSP semantics. The checker expands one complete vector
chunk into a finite table of definitions, uses, effects, transports, and state
transitions. The fixed 4096-entry implementation bound protects checker cost;
the four-lane arithmetic chain expanded over 32 samples requires 4243 entries.
Reducing the chunk to 24 samples stays below the bound and exposes the actual
checked-vector lowering.

Clang reports the certified `-vs 24` C++ as SLP-legal but not profitable:

```text
List vectorization was possible but not beneficial with cost 0 >= 0
```

The dominant structural difference is state storage. Scalar fallback carries
four recursion values in scalar locals that Clang packs. Checked vector FIR
loads and stores four separate arrays (`vstate_s*_tmp`) on every sample and
copies their chunk boundaries, which removes the profitable register-carried
shape.

## 3. Existing invariants that remain frozen

- Lockstep detection stays automatic under `-vec`; no new user option is added.
- Exact prepared-signal isomorphism, graph incomparability, effect commutation,
  common clock/epoch, and fail-closed rejection remain mandatory.
- Logical loop ids, recursion-group ids, and lane order remain stable.
- The external `compute` ABI remains planar.
- Each lane retains its scalar IEEE operation order. No algebraic
  reassociation, parallel-form IIR conversion, or fast-math dependency is
  introduced.
- FMA contraction policy must be identical between scalar and vector paths.
- Unsupported delay, control-flow, effect, or transport shapes retain their
  current checked-vector form or fall back safely.

## 4. Workstream A: compact event-order evidence

### 4.1 Problem

`vector/events.rs` currently materializes every event template once per sample
for the complete `vec_size`. This is useful as a small independent witness but
scales linearly with chunk size and lane-body complexity. Raising 4096 to 8192
would unblock the current example but would only move the next fallback and may
increase pairwise dependency-checking cost substantially.

### 4.2 Proposed representation

Add a compact repeated-region witness for verified lockstep bundles. It should
record:

- the canonical per-sample event templates for each logical lane;
- the checked lane mapping and bundle width;
- the sample interval `0..vec_size`;
- intra-sample dependencies;
- loop-carried dependencies from sample `n` to `n + 1`;
- fixed `LoopPre` and `LoopPost` transitions.

The producer may use the existing expanded model as a development oracle on
small chunks. The production checker must independently validate the compact
witness without trusting producer-computed totals or dependency edges. It must
check template coverage, sample-range arithmetic, lane membership, carried
state adjacency, and the equivalence of scalar-major and lockstep-major orders
under the already-certified commutation obligations.

The compact representation must remain finite and explicitly bounded by the
number of templates, edges, and bundle descriptors. It must not claim a formal
proof beyond the executable certificate assurance level documented by the
vector plan.

### 4.3 Acceptance criteria

- `vector_lockstep_simd_quad.dsp` reports `VectorPipelineStatus::Certified` and
  `VectorEffectiveMode::CertifiedVector` at default `-vs 32`, for `-lv 0/1` and
  all four scheduling strategies.
- A mutation of the sample interval, lane mapping, carried edge, or event
  template is rejected by the independent checker.
- Small-chunk expanded and compact certificates accept and reject the same
  generated mutation corpus.
- Existing non-lockstep event certificates are unchanged unless a shared
  representation is proven equivalent by tests.
- Checker time and peak memory are measured before selecting descriptor bounds;
  no limit increase is accepted without recorded measurements.

## 5. Workstream B: register-carried lockstep state

### 5.1 First supported shape

Start with exact top-rate lockstep bundles whose lane recursion has one scalar
projection and maximum delay one. This covers the committed SIMD-oriented
corpus while keeping the state transformation explicit and independently
checkable.

For each lane, load the persistent prior state once before the physical sample
loop, carry it in a local scalar, and store it once after the loop. The emitted
C++ should have the following semantic shape:

```cpp
float s0 = persistent_state0;
float s1 = persistent_state1;
float s2 = persistent_state2;
float s3 = persistent_state3;

for (int i = begin; i < end; ++i) {
    float y0 = lane_body(input0[i], s0);
    float y1 = lane_body(input1[i], s1);
    float y2 = lane_body(input2[i], s2);
    float y3 = lane_body(input3[i], s3);
    output0[i] = y0;
    output1[i] = y1;
    output2[i] = y2;
    output3[i] = y3;
    s0 = y0;
    s1 = y1;
    s2 = y2;
    s3 = y3;
}

persistent_state0 = s0;
persistent_state1 = s1;
persistent_state2 = s2;
persistent_state3 = s3;
```

The FIR representation should co-locate the bundle id, ordered lane state
identities, initialization sources, and final stores in one checked record.
Assembly must not infer register eligibility from generated variable names.

### 5.2 State-plan and checker obligations

- exactly one persistent load and one persistent store exist per lane;
- the local state value used at sample `n` is the value produced at sample
  `n - 1`, or the persistent entry value for the first sample;
- lane states are neither crossed nor duplicated;
- every early exit or guarded clock path is excluded initially unless the
  checker proves its final-store behavior;
- chunk boundaries preserve the same state as scalar execution;
- output stores and state updates retain canonical lane order without changing
  each lane's expression tree.

The current `vstate_*_tmp` path remains the fallback for unsupported state
shapes. Register carrying is an internal FIR/state representation adaptation,
not an ABI change.

### 5.3 Longer delays

After delay-one acceptance, extend only when justified by corpus evidence.
Prefer a structure-of-arrays layout indexed as `state[delay][lane]`, so values
for one delay across all lanes are contiguous. Do not silently transpose the
external audio ABI. Any chunk-local input/output interleaving must have an
explicit transport-layout record and measured benefit.

### 5.4 Acceptance criteria

- Certified vector C++ for the delay-one SIMD corpus no longer declares or
  updates per-lane `vstate_*_tmp` arrays inside the lockstep kernel.
- Clang `-O3 -ffp-contract=off -S -emit-llvm` emits at least ten arithmetic
  operations on `<4 x float>` for the certified lockstep region.
- The same gate passes for the mixed reduction and unrelated-side-branch
  corpus, and source/IR attribution confirms that SIMD belongs to the lockstep
  region rather than a separate time-vectorizable loop.
- Scalar and vector interpreter outputs are bit-identical for tail chunks,
  both loop variants, all scheduling strategies, and optimization levels zero
  and maximum.
- A malformed lane-state mapping and a missing final persistent store are
  rejected by structural mutation tests.

## 6. Workstream C: trustworthy native-SIMD gate

Replace the current direct C++ compile in `lockstep-simd-check` with this order:

1. compile the source to `FirCompileOutput` using the requested vector mode;
2. require `VectorPipelineStatus::Certified`;
3. require `VectorEffectiveMode::CertifiedVector` and no fallback detail;
4. verify the expected checked-vector chunk/lockstep FIR structure;
5. generate C++ from that exact verified FIR module;
6. compile the wrapper with Clang `-O3 -ffp-contract=off -S -emit-llvm`;
7. count vector floating-point operations attributable to the lockstep kernel.

The gate must fail on the current baseline. A scalar fallback, scalar-mode
compilation, missing bundle, vector instructions from an unrelated loop, or a
forced-vectorizer option must all be negative tests.

Do not use target-specific assembly mnemonics as the primary assertion.
Optimized LLVM vector IR is the portable gate; optional AArch64/x86 assembly
inspection may remain diagnostic evidence.

## 7. Implementation sequence and commits

### Step 0 — correct the trust boundary

- Make the SIMD gate require effective checked-vector status.
- Add the scalar-fallback false-positive regression.
- Mark the previous 14/17/14 result as invalid lockstep evidence in the plan and
  journal.

Pass condition: the corrected gate fails for the documented current reason and
cannot pass on scalar fallback.

Implementation status (2026-07-16): complete. The gate now lowers to
`FirCompileOutput`, requires both certified status and effective checked-vector
mode with no fallback detail, and only then emits C++. Unit tests reject an
`EventCertificate` scalar fallback and accept the exact certified tuple. The
command fails on the current default-size corpus with the expected 4243/4096
diagnostic, establishing the intended red baseline for Step 1.

### Step 1 — compact lockstep event certificate

- Add the compact schema, producer, independent checker, and mutations.
- Retain expanded/compact differential checking on bounded fixtures.

Pass condition: all three complex cases retain checked vector FIR at default
`-vs 32` under the complete strategy/loop-variant matrix.

Implementation status (2026-07-16): complete. `EventOrderCertificate` now
binds the logical chunk length separately from its concretely checked sample
count. Plans with a verified lockstep bundle retain complete expansion while it
fits; otherwise they use the canonical two-sample basis. The first sample
checks every static event template and the second checks adjacent carried
state. The independent checker reconstructs the basis size from routed FIR,
checks translation-identical per-loop templates, and rejects basis, template,
and recursion-edge mutations. All three complex cases are certified at default
`-vs 32` across both loop variants and all scheduling strategies. The corrected
SIMD gate now reaches native code and reports zero vector operations, which is
the intended red baseline for Step 2.

### Step 2 — register-carry delay-one state

- Add the state-plan record, FIR assembly, and independent structural checks.
- Keep unsupported shapes on the existing array-backed path.

Pass condition: bit-exact tests pass and the corrected native-SIMD gate observes
profitable four-wide arithmetic in the certified region.

### Step 3 — mixed-subgraph validation

- Prove that the reduction and side branch remain outside bundle membership.
- Attribute LLVM SIMD to the bundle's generated source range or stable helper.

Pass condition: both mixed corpus cases remain partially lockstep, produce
certified SIMD in that region, and retain their separate non-bundle behavior.

### Step 4 — repository gates

- Run formatting, workspace Clippy, focused mutation/unit/integration tests,
  workspace tests, `vector-interp-opt-check`, golden checks, and the maintained
  vector impulse matrix.
- Update Rustdoc source provenance, the section-8 plan, daily journal, and
  session handoff in every implementation commit.

Pass condition: no lockstep fallback or parity regression is introduced. Any
unrelated existing workspace failure is reported separately and must not be
represented as a passing gate.

## 8. Risks and mitigations

- **Unsound certificate compression:** cross-check compact and expanded models
  on small cases and require independent mutation rejection.
- **Hidden reassociation or contraction drift:** preserve lane expression trees,
  compile evidence without fast-math, and compare exact interpreter bits.
- **C++ alias-cost instability:** retain planar ABI and use register-carried
  states first; introduce layout-changing transports only with explicit records
  and measurements.
- **Backend-specific leakage:** keep the FIR state contract backend-neutral;
  Clang LLVM inspection validates one backend optimization, not language-level
  semantics for every backend.
- **Over-broad eligibility:** begin with delay-one, top-rate, unguarded scalar
  recursion and fail closed for every other shape.
- **Checker resource growth:** bound compact descriptors and benchmark the
  checker instead of repeatedly raising the expanded-event ceiling.

## 9. Required validation commands

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p transform --lib
cargo test -p compiler --test vector_mode
cargo test -p xtask --all-targets
cargo run -p xtask -- vector-interp-opt-check
cargo run -p xtask -- lockstep-simd-check
cargo run -p xtask -- golden-check
make -j8 interp-vec0 interp-vec1 -C tests/impulse-tests
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```

Every reported SIMD result must include the requested vector size, effective
pipeline status, compiler and optimization flags, vector-operation count, and
the corpus case whose lockstep region produced those operations.
