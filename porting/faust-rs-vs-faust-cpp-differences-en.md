# `faust-rs` Differences From Faust C++

Status: living compatibility registry

Last reviewed: 2026-10-01 (soundfile channel wrap); full review 2026-08-13

C++ reference: `master-dev-ocpp-od-fir-2-FIR19` at `8eebea429`

## 1. Purpose and scope

Semantic parity with Faust C++ remains the default objective of `faust-rs`.
This file records the places where the port deliberately does something else,
adds a Rust-only surface, exposes an adapted contract, or has a known narrower
scope. It is the first document to consult before assuming that a difference is
a regression.

The registry covers externally observable and compatibility-relevant
differences:

- Faust source accepted only by one compiler;
- command-line options, modes, defaults, and validation;
- generated-code, initialization, scheduling, and diagnostic behavior;
- backends and delivery forms that exist only on one side;
- public Rust/C/C++ API adaptations;
- durable exclusions and known coverage gaps.

It does not enumerate ordinary implementation differences that preserve the
same contract, such as Rust ownership, arena indices in place of pointers, or
private helper decomposition. Those belong in the relevant phase documents.
It also does not turn a prototype or an unmerged plan into a supported feature:
an item is listed as implemented only when it is reachable in the current
tree and covered by tests or an explicit contract document.

Detailed support breadth remains in
[`faust-rs-supported-faust-subset-en.md`](faust-rs-supported-faust-subset-en.md).
Backend-specific ABI detail remains in the corresponding parity matrices. This
file is the consolidated index of differences, not a replacement for those
documents.

## 2. Classification

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `extension` | `faust-rs` intentionally adds a source, CLI, backend, diagnostic, or API capability absent from the pinned C++ reference. |
| `adapted` | Both sides expose the same broad capability, but the accepted inputs, output shape, ownership, validation, or observability contract differs. |
| `narrower` | Faust C++ supports a broader production surface; Rust rejects or defers part of it. |
| `excluded` | The difference is frozen as a non-goal unless a planning decision explicitly reopens it. |
| `reference-fix` | Rust intentionally avoids a known behavior or defect observed in the pinned C++ implementation. |
| `parity-gap` | The current Rust behavior differs observably from C++ without being an intended extension; it remains a defect to close. |

These labels are compatibility statements, not quality rankings. In
particular, `adapted` must not be presented as `1:1`, and an independently
verified Rust extension must not be presented as a proof of C++ parity.

## 3. Faust source-language extensions

### DIFF-SRC-001 — explicit-seed forward automatic differentiation

- Status: `extension`.
- Rust surface: `fad(expr, seeds)`.
- Difference: the pinned C++ reference does not provide this explicit-seed
  source contract. Rust accepts one or more seed outputs and returns primal and
  tangent lanes. Multi-seed recursion is carried through one augmented
  recursive group rather than rebuilding a primal shadow per seed.
- Additional adapted behavior: differentiating a read-only table index uses a
  symmetric finite-difference slope. This is a documented derivative model,
  not C++ semantic parity.
- Implemented correction at `f18a50c8`: bargraphs forward the wrapped signal's
  tangents while retaining the meter on the rebuilt primal; see the
  [2026-09-19 review](fad-clock-domains-explanation-and-review-2026-09-19-en.md).
- Additional adapted behavior (shared with `rad`): a widget referenced from a
  seed is one control in every group context (C++ makes the group path part
  of a widget's identity, and so does `faust-rs` outside seeds, see
  `replicated_widgets_wire_distinct_dsp_fields`), and that control owns one
  UI leaf, at the body's group path; a seed the body never reads is placed at
  the root. Guarded by `ad_seed_references_unify_to_one_control` and
  `ad_seed_reference_is_placed_once_at_its_body_group_path` in
  `crates/compiler/src/tests.rs`, described in
  [`docs/fad-note-en.md`](../docs/fad-note-en.md) §2.1.
- Compatibility impact: DSPs using this form are `faust-rs` programs and must
  not be expected to compile with the pinned C++ compiler.
- Evidence:
  [`docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md`](../docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md),
  [`faust-rs-supported-faust-subset-en.md`](faust-rs-supported-faust-subset-en.md),
  and the `tests/corpus/fad_*.dsp` fixtures.

### DIFF-SRC-002 — explicit-seed reverse automatic differentiation

- Status: `extension`.
- Rust surface: `rad(expr, seeds)`.
- Difference: Rust returns the primal outputs followed by one gradient lane per
  seed, using an implicit all-ones cotangent for a multi-output body. Temporal
  and recursive bodies use the finite-horizon `BlockReverseAD` fallback; the
  specialized reverse-time recursion route remains disabled.
- Known gap at `f18a50c8`: the symbolic bargraph path still returns zero
  contribution despite the bargraph's signal identity. The FAD correction
  does not fix this RAD path; a numerical witness is recorded in the
  [2026-09-19 review, §10](fad-clock-domains-explanation-and-review-2026-09-19-en.md#10-what-these-results-do-not-establish).
- Compatibility impact: the source form and `BlockReverseAD` semantics have no
  pinned C++ source/backend oracle. Validation uses symbolic identities,
  FAD/RAD agreement, finite differences, and optimized/unoptimized runtime
  comparisons.
- Evidence: [`docs/rad-note-en.md`](../docs/rad-note-en.md),
  [`docs/rad-usage-en.md`](../docs/rad-usage-en.md), and
  `crates/compiler/tests/rad_runtime.rs`.

### DIFF-SRC-003 — AD across clock-domain constructs

- Status: `extension`.
- Difference: Rust defines and checks FAD augmentation across supported
  `ondemand`, upsampling, and downsampling boundaries. This is a composition of
  Rust AD with clock-domain machinery, not a parity claim against C++.
  Implemented at `f18a50c8`: an augmented block owns a fresh domain (including
  nested state), shared by its primal and tangents; a separately consumed
  original retains its own domain. Clock decisions are not differentiated.
  A surviving original-domain annotation is reported as the compiler defect
  `FadTwinKeepsOriginalDomain`. Reconstruction remains incomplete for a nested
  `upsampling` factor carrying a twinned outer-domain annotation: `ZeroPad`
  retains the original factor, and the invariant check rejects the program.
- Compatibility impact: portable Faust code should not depend on these AD
  combinations unless it explicitly targets `faust-rs`.
- Evidence:
  [`ondemand-vec-fad-interleave-synthesis-2026-07-07-en.md`](ondemand-vec-fad-interleave-synthesis-2026-07-07-en.md),
  [implementation explanation and review, 2026-09-19](fad-clock-domains-explanation-and-review-2026-09-19-en.md),
  [`ondemand_pipeline.rs`](../crates/compiler/tests/ondemand_pipeline.rs),
  [`fad_recursive_runtime.rs`](../crates/compiler/tests/fad_recursive_runtime.rs).

### DIFF-SRC-004 — control inputs as boxes and the wildcard modulation target

- Status: `extension`.
- Rust surface: `cinputs(e)`, `cinput(i, e)`, `coutputs(e)`, `coutput(i, e)`
  (new keywords), and the modulation target `"*"` / `"group/*"`.
- Difference: the four primitives fold at evaluation to lists of `e`'s widget
  boxes (`cinputs`: the `par` of its sliders, numentries, buttons and
  checkboxes; `cinput`: `(widget, init, min, max, step)`; the bargraph twins
  `(bargraph, min, max)`), in the order of `e`'s own interface, dead widgets included (groups merged,
  children sorted by raw label, as the C++ UI is). A wildcard target rebinds
  every matched control input, bargraphs excepted, and gives a two-input
  modulator **one extra input per control** in that order, where a literal
  label shares one input between its matches (kept, as in C++). A wildcard
  matching nothing is the error `FRS-EVAL-0010`; a literal target matching
  nothing stays the C++ warning and dangling input (`FRS-EVAL-0008`). An index
  that is not a compile-time integer, negative or past the count is
  `FRS-EVAL-0009`.
- Compatibility impact: the four names become reserved words, so a program
  that defines `cinputs`, `cinput`, `coutputs` or `coutput` no longer parses.
  The C++ compiler rejects the primitives as unknown identifiers and parses a
  wildcard target as a label that matches nothing (a dangling input and a
  warning under `-wall`), so a program using them is a `faust-rs` program.
  `optimizers.lib` 0.11.0 (`adaptive_fad`, `adaptive_rad`) and the
  Rust-only library `controls.lib` 0.2.0 (smoothing, CV inputs, rebuilt
  interfaces, morphing, randomizing, sweeps, gradients over every control of
  a program) depend on them.
- Evidence: [`docs/control-inputs-en.md`](../docs/control-inputs-en.md),
  [analysis and contract](control-inputs-and-wildcard-modulation-analysis-2026-09-22-en.md),
  [`control_inputs.rs`](../crates/compiler/tests/control_inputs.rs) on the
  `tests/corpus/cinputs_*.dsp`, `wildcard_*.dsp` and `err_3{0,1}_*.dsp`
  fixtures,
  `adaptive_operators_follow_the_hand_written_loop` in
  [`optimizers_lib.rs`](../crates/compiler/tests/optimizers_lib.rs),
  [`controls_lib.rs`](../crates/compiler/tests/controls_lib.rs) on the
  `tests/corpus/ctl_*.dsp` fixtures.

## 4. Command-line additions and differences

### 4.1 Rust-only code-generation options

| ID | Rust option | Status | Difference and compatibility impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DIFF-CLI-001 | `--table-init runtime|const` | `extension` | C++ behavior corresponds to `runtime`: every generated table is filled by a sub-container during initialization. Rust additionally keeps `const`, which evaluates the generator during compilation and emits literal table contents. The default is `runtime`. |
| DIFF-CLI-002 | `--table-init-sample-rate HZ` | `extension` | Required when `--table-init const` folds a generator that reads `ma.SR`. The positive integer is embedded permanently in the table. There is no implicit default. Under `--warn`, `FRS-COMP-0006` reports the frozen value and suggests `runtime` when the host SR must remain authoritative. |
| DIFF-CLI-009 | `-e` / `--export-dsp` | `1:1` | Expands a DSP into a self-contained program, as C++ `-e`. `-lang` is accepted and recorded in `compile_options`, matching C++, since it selects a backend the expansion does not use; two emitters (`-e --dump-cpp`) still conflict. With no `-o` faust-rs prints to standard output, where C++ produces nothing; see `DIFF-BEH-006` for the full list of deviations. |
| DIFF-CLI-003 | `--dlt N` | `extension` | Selects the delay-line threshold at which Rust changes from power-of-two circular storage to exact-size if-wrapped storage. The compiler records it in `compile_options`; the pinned C++ CLI has no direct counterpart. |
| DIFF-CLI-010 | `-mem` / `-mem0` / long aliases | `adapted` | The four C++ mode-zero spellings normalize to one typed per-request `MemoryManagerMode::Mem0` and canonical `-mem0` metadata. The option is intentionally limited to scalar C, C++, and native Cranelift; C and Cranelift are Rust extensions, while `mem1`–`mem3`, vector mode, `-it`, and other backends fail closed. M1 implements parsing/propagation; M2 implements the shared version-2 layout/cost analysis. M3 implements generated C++ allocation with the legacy `dsp_memory_manager` surface plus additive checked methods. It intentionally fixes the reference's empty `init`, shallow clone, wrong-manager destruction, unchecked failure/alignment, static-table sentinel, and non-transactional cleanup defects; the emitted `Int64`/`Bool` enum extension requires the faust-rs-compatible manager header when those types occur. M4 implements the Rust-only C surface through the versioned, context-carrying `faust_memory_manager` ABI in `ffi-common`, with self-contained header emission, checked class operations, captured per-instance managers, explicit alignment, and transactional instance allocation. M5 implements Cranelift pointer-slot lowering, managed object/instance/class storage, deep clone, unbound-factory failure, copied callback binding, and functional C/C++ factory set/get. The Rust wrapper remains cache-allocated outside the manager-visible logical JIT state, and the legacy C++ adapter maps the appended `Int64`/`Bool` categories to its generic object categories because upstream `dsp_memory_manager::MemType` has no such values. M6 emits the additive version-2 `memory_manager`, `memory_layout`, and corrected `compute_cost` blocks only under `mem0`, selects the backend-specific manager/target ABI, and replaces Cranelift's former minimal hand-written JSON with the shared strict serializer while retaining its status keys. Ordinary non-`mem0` strict JSON remains byte-stable. M7 adds the focused self-contained C/C++/Cranelift impulse audit; the completed gate also runs each public backend target over the full oracle-supported `dsp/` corpus, with semantic JSON and cross-backend cost equality. The expanded corpus additionally guards corrected helper-object layout, embedded helper arrays, helper lifetime, and strict-C soundfile behavior. M8 adds a live pinned-C++ structural/JSON differential, exact common-subset cost parity, focused D6 allowlist tests, C/C++/Cranelift O0/O3 parity, sanitizer coverage, and Cranelift serialization/rebinding coverage. See the authoritative [mem0 plan](custom-memory-manager-mem0-analysis-and-porting-plan-2026-08-13-en.md). |

`--table-init const` remains a permanent supported mode, not migration
scaffolding. See
[`siggen-subcontainer-table-init-port-plan-2026-08-05-en.md`](siggen-subcontainer-table-init-port-plan-2026-08-05-en.md)
and `tests/corpus/rep_86_table_const_sr.dsp`.

### 4.2 Rust-only inspection, verification, and diagnostics modes

The following are `faust-rs` CLI surfaces. Some expose concepts that can be
inspected through C++ development tools, but they are not compatibility aliases
for a pinned C++ command-line contract:

- pipeline inspection: `--parse`, `--dump-box`, `--dump-sig`, `--dump-fir`,
  `--dump-fir-verify`, and `--check`;
- golden/debug inputs: `--golden`, `--fir-fixture`, and
  `--list-fir-fixtures`;
- interpreter conversion: `--dump-cpp-from-fbc` and `--cpp-class-name`;
- lowering selection/verification: `--signal-fir-lane`, `--no-fir-verify`,
  and `--fir-verify-strict`;
- structured presentation: `--error-format human|json`,
  `--error-verbosity concise|standard|debug|full`, `--diagnostic-paths`, and
  `--help-error-format`.

These modes may be used by tests, CI, IDEs, and integrations, but scripts that
must run unchanged with Faust C++ should not pass them.

### 4.3 Adapted option behavior

| ID | Surface | Status | Difference and compatibility impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| DIFF-CLI-004 | `--warn` | `adapted` | It covers warning classes related to C++ `-wall`/`-me`, but returns structured, source-linked diagnostics through the Rust warning bundle. Warnings are opt-in and never change successful compilation into failure. |
| DIFF-CLI-005 | `-ss N` parsing | `adapted` | Rust uses typed `clap` parsing: missing, non-integer, or negative values are errors. C++ `atoi`-style parsing can silently produce `0`. Rust applies the decoded scheduling strategy consistently to scalar and checked-vector scheduling. |
| DIFF-CLI-006 | compilation-options text | `adapted` | Rust prints flags only when they differ from the CLI default, except precision, which is always printed. C++ prints some defaults, notably `-mcd`, unconditionally. Rust also records its own `-table-init`, `--table-init-sample-rate`, and `-dlt` settings. |
| DIFF-CLI-007 | `-ec`/`-os` capability validation | `adapted` | Rust rejects unsupported backend combinations and block-sensitive one-sample programs with stable typed diagnostics. `-ec` on FIR is intentionally exposed as a Rust diagnostic/inspection extension. |
| DIFF-CLI-008 | unknown or invalid combinations | `adapted` | The Rust CLI generally fails early through typed option validation rather than relying on permissive legacy parsing or a later backend failure. Scripts depending on C++ option coercion must be corrected. |

### 4.4 Rust-only companion tool

- **DIFF-CLI-011 — `faustprobe`.** Status: `extension`. A second binary
  (`crates/cranelift-ffi`, `src/bin/faustprobe/`) that JIT-compiles a program
  with the Cranelift backend and measures it offline: controls set, swept and
  scheduled from the command line, statistics (subnormal outputs included),
  bargraph read-out, binary output (`--out`), expressions evaluated in a file's
  scope (`--eval`), two renders compared and the invariants of one checked
  (`--compare`, `--ref`, `--check`), a host loop for programs that output a
  loss and its gradients (`--train`, with a grid of starting points under
  `--sweep`, and `--fd-check` at the start or the end of the descent), the cost
  of the `compute` calls against real time (`--time`), a compile failure as
  the compiler's diagnostics-v2 JSON report (`--error-format json`), and the
  frequency response of a program checked to be linear and time-invariant
  (`--freqresp`). The `faust-rs` options that choose the program or shape its
  code are `faust-rs`'s own declaration, `compiler::CompileOptionArgs`,
  shared with the two impulse runners, and forwarded under their `faust-rs`
  spellings; `-ec`, `-os` and `-mem0` are refused
  (`crates/cranelift-ffi/tests/compiler_options_probe.rs`). It
  has no C++ counterpart; the closest reference tools are the `impulse-tests`
  runners, whose protocol it reproduces byte for byte under `--protocol
  impulse-test`. Evidence:
  [`docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md`](../docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md),
  [`faustprobe-generic-test-tool-design-2026-08-14-en.md`](faustprobe-generic-test-tool-design-2026-08-14-en.md).
  Comparisons at zero absolute and relative tolerance require bit identity,
  including signed zeros. `--check determinism` runs its second compilation
  and render in a separate process so equal FIR keys cannot reuse the first
  JIT. Its hidden `--determinism-worker` mode and JSON bit-pattern response
  are a private implementation protocol, not a stable host API. This leaves
  the C/C++ factory cache contract unchanged. Regression coverage:
  `crates/cranelift-ffi/tests/compare_probe.rs` and
  `crates/cranelift-ffi/src/bin/faustprobe/determinism.rs`.

## 5. Runtime, lowering, and generated-code behavior

### DIFF-BEH-001 — const tables freeze initialization context

- Status: `extension`.
- With `--table-init runtime`, sub-containers receive the host's
  `init(sample_rate)` value, matching the C++ lifecycle.
- With `--table-init const`, table contents are compiler artifacts. A generator
  reading `ma.SR` therefore requires `--table-init-sample-rate`; changing the
  host initialization SR later does not change the table.
- A missing explicit SR is a typed `FRS-SFIR-0004` failure, not a hidden
  44.1-kHz or other default.

### DIFF-BEH-002 — nested generated tables are initialized

- Status: `reference-fix`.
- Rust initializes an inner generated table before the outer generator that
  consumes it.
- The pinned C++ implementation observed during the SIGGEN port declares the
  nested inner table but does not fill it, leaving zero content.
- Compatibility impact: programs accidentally depending on the pinned defect
  can produce different samples. Rust's behavior is the intended dependency
  order and has a structural regression test.
- Evidence: the nesting contract in
  [`siggen-subcontainer-table-init-port-plan-2026-08-05-en.md`](siggen-subcontainer-table-init-port-plan-2026-08-05-en.md).

### DIFF-BEH-003 — checked vector admission and scalar fallback

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust builds and verifies an explicit vector plan. A program shape that cannot
  be certified falls back to scalar lowering instead of emitting an unchecked
  vector schedule.
- `FirCompileOutput` exposes the requested/effective mode and the fallback
  reason. This observability surface has no equivalent C++ ABI contract.
- Scheduling ties are resolved deterministically from stable Rust IR ids;
  pointer-order byte identity with C++ is not promised.
- Compatibility impact: `-vec` can succeed while producing scalar Rust output.
  Callers that require effective vectorization must inspect the reported
  status, not infer it from exit code alone.
- Evidence:
  [`vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md`](vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md).

### DIFF-BEH-004 — one-sample and external-control safety boundary

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust preserves the public lifecycle intent of `-ec` and `-os`, but checks the
  selected backend and FIR requirements before emission. `-os -vec`, foreign
  `count` use, and block-sensitive reverse AD are rejected rather than assigned
  an invented one-sample meaning.
- Evidence:
  [`external-control-one-sample-port-plan-2026-07-23-en.md`](external-control-one-sample-port-plan-2026-07-23-en.md).

### DIFF-BEH-005 — diagnostic model

- Status: `extension` / `adapted`.
- Rust errors and warnings carry stable `FRS-*` codes, typed facts, source
  labels, traces, fixes, related diagnostics, verbosity filtering, and a clean
  JSON channel.
- Diagnostic wording, code, and stage are not generally byte-compatible with
  C++ stderr. Exit success/failure and the underlying semantic rejection remain
  the parity objective for portable cases.
- Duplicate UI paths, FIR verification, backend limitations, and const-table SR
  freezing have dedicated Rust diagnostics.
- Evidence: [`docs/faust-error-model-en.md`](../docs/faust-error-model-en.md)
  and
  [`docs/diagnostics-codes-reference-en.md`](../docs/diagnostics-codes-reference-en.md).

### DIFF-BEH-006 — `-e` expansion and `expandDSP` result

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust serializes the evaluated Box tree back to Faust source, as C++
  `boxppShared` does. On the 33-fixture corpus that has a recorded C++
  expansion, the two compilers produce byte-identical documents apart from the
  values listed below. Corpus and capture tool:
  [`tests/expand/`](../tests/expand/README.md),
  `cargo run -p xtask -- expand-oracle`.
- Values that differ by construction, and cannot match:
  - `declare version` carries the faust-rs version;
  - `declare compile_options` carries the faust-rs option spelling;
  - `declare library_path<i>` carries installation-dependent absolute paths.
- Deliberate deviations:
  - with no `-o`, faust-rs prints the expansion to standard output. C++ writes
    to `ofstream(gOutpath)` and, with `gOutpath` empty, produces nothing while
    exiting 0.
  - real literals take their suffix from the precision alone. C++ derives it
    from `gOutputLang` too (`compiler/generator/floats.cpp:49`), so the same
    program expands to `3.1415927f` under `-lang cpp`, `3.1415927` under
    `-lang rust`, and `3.1415927f0` under `-lang julia` — the last being Julia
    literal syntax in a `.dsp` file, which the Faust parser rejects with
    `syntax error, unexpected INT`. A backend must not leak into a document
    that is Faust source.
  - box shapes with no Faust source syntax (`with { ... }`, `letrec`, evaluator
    closures, partially-applied pattern matchers) are refused with
    `FRS-COMP-0007` rather than printed as the placeholders C++ emits
    (`closure[...]`, `PM[...]`, a raw tree dump inside `with { }`), none of
    which re-parse. They cannot occur in a successfully evaluated `process`.
  - `downsampling(...)` is printed. C++ cannot expand any program containing
    it: `boxppShared::print` tests `isBoxUpsampling` twice
    (`compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp:615-617`) and throws on `BoxDownsampling`. The
    non-shared `boxpp` printer handles the node correctly at
    `compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp:467`, so the defect is reachable only through
    `-e`.
- Shared behavior worth stating, because it looks like a defect and is not:
  expansion converges after the *second* pass, not the first, in both
  compilers. The second pass grows the header (an expansion declares its own
  `version` and `compile_options`, which the next pass reads as ordinary
  metadata) and can shrink the body (re-evaluating `(65536 : int)` folds it to
  `65536`). The third pass equals the second.
- Generated state-carrier names are program-local, as in C++: compiling a
  program and compiling its expansion produce the same `fRec`/`iRec` names.
  (Until 2026-08-12 they were numbered by arena node id and drifted; see
  `DIFF-BEH-009`.)
- `generateAuxFiles` returns owned artifact descriptions in the Rust facade;
  the C entry points in `crates/libfaust-ffi` write them to disk or return the
  single requested one, and report rather than guess when a request selects
  none, several, or a binary output.

### DIFF-BEH-009 — generated variable numbering

- Status: `adapted`.
- Generated names are numbered densely and in allocation order, per family:
  `fConst`, `iConst`, `fSlow`, `fTemp`, `tbl`, `Wave`, `SIG`, and — since
  2026-08-12 — the recursion carriers `fRec`/`iRec`/`fRecCur`/`iRecCur`. The
  numbering describes the program, not the compilation session.
- The numbers themselves are **not** expected to equal the C++ ones: both
  compilers assign in traversal order, and the traversals differ. What is
  guaranteed is that recompiling the same program — directly, or from its `-e`
  expansion — yields the same names.
- Evidence:
  `crates/compiler/tests/expand_corpus.rs::generated_names_do_not_depend_on_what_was_evaluated_first`.

### DIFF-BEH-007 — import delivery environments

- Status: `adapted`.
- Native Rust compilation supports local search directories, structural local
  imports, direct HTTP(S) entry sources, explicit URL imports, relative imports
  within remote graphs, and remote main architecture templates. The native
  transport requires the default-off `network-imports` Cargo feature and the
  per-run `--allow-network-imports` option.
- Unlike C++'s process-global socket fetcher, Rust exposes a per-compiler
  injected capability with URL policies, redirect re-authorization, bounded
  bodies, real HTTPS, and structured errors. Remote evaluator-driven
  `component(...)`/`library(...)`, remote inline architecture sub-includes, and
  C/C++ compatibility-facade opt-in are still deferred.
- The `wasm-ffi` embedded compiler ships standard libraries as read-only
  virtual sources and accepts host-prefetched URL/source bundles through
  repeated `--remote-source <url> <base64>` arguments. The module performs no
  browser network I/O and does not depend on an Emscripten filesystem; URL
  identity and relative URL imports are preserved inside the supplied graph.
- Compatibility impact: native CLI builds must opt in twice; browser callers
  must fetch the complete graph asynchronously and supply it explicitly before
  entering the synchronous compiler ABI.

### DIFF-BEH-008 — relative pathname navigation in explicit group labels

- Status: `extension`.
- Faust C++ applies pathname normalization such as `../` when a terminal UI
  element (slider, button, bargraph, soundfile, and so on) is propagated. It
  pushes explicit `hgroup`, `vgroup`, and `tgroup` labels directly onto the UI
  path instead, so `vgroup("../Bar", ...)` remains a group literally named
  `../Bar` in generated UI code.
- Rust preserves the C++ behavior for terminal UI elements and additionally
  resolves `./`, repeated `../`, and an absolute `/` prefix on explicit group
  labels. Navigation above the canonical UI root is clamped at that root.
- Compatibility impact: a DSP using pathname navigation in a group label can
  produce a different UI hierarchy, parameter addresses, JSON description,
  or OSC/API path under Rust. Portable DSPs should restrict relative pathname
  navigation to terminal UI element labels.
- Evidence: the C++ comparison and frozen Rust semantics in
  [`ui-ir-architecture-contract-2026-03-12-en.md`](ui-ir-architecture-contract-2026-03-12-en.md),
  plus corpus cases
  [`rep_63_ui_relative_group_rebase.dsp`](../tests/corpus/rep_63_ui_relative_group_rebase.dsp)
  and
  [`rep_64_ui_relative_group_root_clamp.dsp`](../tests/corpus/rep_64_ui_relative_group_root_clamp.dsp).

### DIFF-BEH-010 — division and remainder by a constant zero

- Status: `adapted` (same rejection, different report), with one `parity-gap`
  recorded as `DIFF-GAP-017`.
- Both compilers reject a division by a constant zero with exit status 1, in
  integers **and in reals**: neither folds `2.0 / 0` to an infinity. C++ prints
  `ERROR : division by 0 in 2 / 0`, thrown by `mterm::operator/=` while the
  evaluator folds a numeric sequence. Rust raises `FRS-EVAL-0007` at the same
  point, located in the source, with the division as written (`expr=(2 / n)`)
  next to the one that was folded (`2.0 / 0`); a divisor that becomes a constant
  zero only in the signal graph (`_ / (0 : *(0))`, `_ / 0`) is reported by the
  typing stage as `FRS-COMP-0004`, as is a remainder by zero (`% by 0`).
- Until 2026-09-17 the evaluator's folds were not under the boundary that
  catches the normalizer's unwind: `process = 2.0 / 0;` panicked the compiler
  and, through the FFI, aborted the host. `0 / 0`, `0.0 / 0.0` and `0 % 0`
  compiled to a silent 0, which the reference rejects. Both are fixed.
- Integer folds that overflow in Rust follow the reference: `i32::MIN % -1` is
  0, `i32::MIN / -1` is the real 2147483648, additions and multiplications wrap,
  a shift count is taken modulo 32.
- Evidence: `crates/compiler/tests/diagnostic_errors.rs`
  (`a_constant_division_by_zero_is_a_located_eval_error` and the four tests
  after it), `tests/corpus/err_18` to `err_20`, measured against Faust 2.89.

### DIFF-BEH-011 — compile-time mathematical domain

- Status: `adapted` (stricter on two functions) and `reference-fix` (sign of an
  infinite constant).
- Both compilers reject a constant argument outside a function's domain:
  `sqrt(-1)`, `log(-1)`, `acos(2)`, `asin(2)`, `fmod(x, 0)`, `remainder(x, 0)`
  (C++ `ERROR : out of domain in sqrt(-1)`, Rust `FRS-COMP-0004`, with the
  inferred intervals).
- **Rust also rejects `log(0)` and `log10(0)`**, the boundary of the domain;
  C++ accepts them and folds an infinity. A program that relies on it must
  write the infinity it wants. Both compilers accept `pow(-1, 0.5)` (NaN),
  `exp(1000)` (infinity) and `atan2(0, 0)` (0).
- **Sign of an infinite constant.** Faust 2.89 prints a negative infinity as
  `INFINITY`: `0 - exp(1000)` and `log(_ * 0)` both generate
  `static_cast<FAUSTFLOAT>(INFINITY)`, in the C and C++ backends. Rust generates
  `-INFINITY`. The outputs of the two compilers therefore differ, and the Rust
  one is the intended value.
- Evidence: `crates/compiler/tests/diagnostic_errors.rs`
  (`compile_time_math_domain_error_is_typed_and_source_located`); the table of
  cases is in `porting/journal/2026-09-17.md`.

### DIFF-BEH-012 — `abs` of an integer constant

- Status: parity reached on 2026-09-17; kept here because the behavior is the
  reference's and is not the mathematical one.
- `abs` is the one unary function that keeps an integer an integer. Its
  constant fold now does: `abs(-3)` is the integer 3 (it was the real 3.0, and
  `abs(-2147483647)` the float 2147483648.0). `abs(-2147483648)` is
  **-2147483648**, as in C++: there is no absolute value of `i32::MIN` in 32
  bits, and the fold wraps the way the `std::abs(int)` both compilers emit for a
  non-constant argument does, so that a folded expression and a computed one
  agree.
- Evidence: `crates/normalize/src/simplify.rs`
  (`abs_of_an_integer_constant_stays_an_integer`).

### DIFF-BEH-013 — one clocked block for one definition, whatever the slot environments it is read in

- Status: `adapted` (fewer clocked-block instances than the C++ reference, same
  samples), implemented 2026-09-21.
- C++ `propagate` memoises a call on `(slotenv, path, box, inputs)` and
  `makeClockEnv` names an `ondemand` block's environment by the same tuple: a
  definition holding a clocked wrapper, read at the top level and again inside
  the body of a `boxSymbolic` (every `f ~ g` whose `f` is an unapplied
  function), is propagated twice and the wrapper becomes two blocks, both
  computed. Rust keys the result memo on the environment *restricted to the
  box's free slots* (`propagate::flat::free_slots`,
  `SlotEnv::restricted_id`), the empty one for a closed box, leaves the
  `suppress_fad` mode out of the key of a box holding no `fad`, and memoises
  a recursion holding a `fad` from its first call: the second reading hits
  the first propagation and replays its domain, so the definition is one
  block. `t = (clk, x) : ondemand(exp); process = t + ((\(r).(t + 0.5 * r)) ~ _)`
  emits one `exp` where C++ emits two; a descent of `optimizers.lib` whose
  loss reads a clocked model that the program reads too runs one model per
  reading less (`porting/journal/2026-09-21.md`, `porting/MEMOIZATION.md`
  §2.22).
- Compatibility impact: the generated code differs from C++ in the number of
  block instances and their domain ids, never in the samples: the merged
  blocks had the same clock, the same inputs and the same body, so the same
  state. `DIFF-BACK-004` already frees the generated text from byte identity.
  A program that relied on two instances of one definition having two states
  cannot exist: the two were fed the same signals by construction.
- A definition that depends on an enclosing recursion's variable and is read
  at two binder depths is still propagated twice (the variable is lifted
  under the inner binder), as in C++; recorded as open in the journal.
- Tests: `crates/compiler/tests/closed_box_memo.rs`,
  `propagate::tests::closed_clocked_box_is_one_block_across_slot_environments`.

### DIFF-BEH-014 — a widget parameter that is not a compile-time number

- Status: `adapted` (same rejection, different report), fixed 2026-09-24.
- Both compilers reject a `hslider`, `vslider` or `nentry` init, min, max or
  step, or a bargraph min or max, that does not fold to a number. C++ stops in
  `eval2double` (`compiler/evaluate/eval.cpp`) with `not a constant expression
  of type : (0->1)` when the parameter box is not `0→1` (`_`, `(1, 2)`), and
  in `tree2double` (`compiler/tlib/tree.cpp`) with `the parameter must be a
  real constant numerical expression : SigInput[10001]` when it is a `0→1`
  signal known only at run time (`0.5 : \(x).(hslider("a", x, 0, 1, 0.1))`,
  a `case` rule applied with `:`, `vslider("a", 0.5, 0, button("b"), 0.1)`).
  Rust raises `FRS-EVAL-0011` at the same point, located in the source, with
  the C++ wording, the widget, its label, the parameter and the expression as
  written.
- Until 2026-09-24 Rust kept the unevaluated parameter and the UI builder read
  it as 0: those programs compiled, with an init, a min or a max of 0, and a
  bargraph whose max was a lambda argument failed later with a propagation
  arity error.
- Compatibility impact: none for a program C++ accepts; the programs Rust used
  to accept are the ones C++ rejects.
- Evidence: [`err_33_widget_parameter_not_constant.dsp`](../tests/corpus/err_33_widget_parameter_not_constant.dsp),
  `a_widget_parameter_that_is_not_a_number_is_refused_like_the_reference` in
  `crates/compiler/tests/diagnostic_errors.rs`.

### DIFF-BEH-015 — the order of widgets with equal labels in a group

- Status: `adapted`, 2026-09-27.
- Both compilers sort the items of a UI group by their label as written, so
  widgets with equal labels, typically unlabelled ones, are ordered by
  whatever order they had before the sort. Rust keeps the source order.
- C++ up to Faust 2.89.2 built each group's list by prepending (`addKey`,
  `compiler/generator/uitree.cpp`) and sorted it with an unstable
  `std::sort` (`sortPropList`): that order was left to the standard library,
  and `checkNullBargraphLabel` numbered the unlabelled bargraphs in it, so
  which one was `hbargraph0` depended on it too. Fixed in Faust 2.89.3
  (`ed7c12606`, a `std::stable_sort` over the insertion order): each
  unlabelled bargraph now gets the same number in both compilers (the first
  `hbargraph("")` of the source is `hbargraph0`).
- What remains: C++ inserts a widget when it compiles its signal, not in
  source order, so fixed C++ can still list equal-labelled widgets in another
  order than Rust: for `hslider("", …) + (1 : hbargraph("", …)) + (2 :
  hbargraph("", …)) + (3 : vbargraph("", …))`, fixed C++ declares
  `vbargraph0`, `hbargraph0`, `hbargraph1`, `0x00` and Rust `0x00`,
  `hbargraph0`, `hbargraph1`, `vbargraph0`, each name on the same widget.
- The names match: an unlabelled group or input widget is `0x00` and an
  unlabelled bargraph `hbargraph<n>` / `vbargraph<n>`, and two unlabelled
  input widgets in one group are refused as in C++ (`FRS-UI-0001`,
  `path '…/0x00' is already used`).
- Compatibility impact: the order of equal-labelled widgets in
  `buildUserInterface` and the JSON; against Faust 2.89.2 also which
  unlabelled bargraph takes which number. Names, paths and values match
  Faust 2.89.3.
- Evidence: `crates/compiler/tests/anonymous_ui_labels.rs`,
  `unlabelled_controls_are_named_as_in_cpp_and_can_conflict` and
  `anonymous_widget_names_count_per_prefix_like_get_fresh_id` in
  `crates/ui/tests/core_api.rs`.

### DIFF-BEH-016 — soundfile channel wrap generated as `chan % fChannels`

- Status: `adapted`, 2026-10-01: ahead of the pinned C++ reference, in step
  with the C++ `rework-soundfile` branch (`49c6d9367`, `5c1b9b257`; follow-up
  to grame-cncm/faust#1322), not yet in `master-dev`.
- A `soundfile(label, N)` read whose resource has fewer than `N` channels
  reads real channel `chan % fChannels`. Rust generates that wrap in every
  backend (C, C++, Rust, Julia, WASM, AssemblyScript, Cranelift, interpreter),
  from one lowering rule shared by the scalar and vector lowerers
  (`emit_soundfile_buffer`, `crates/transform/src/signal_fir/leaf_emit.rs`)
  over a new FIR load `LoadSoundfileChannels` (`fSoundN->fChannels`).
  Constant channel 0 is not wrapped, as in C++.
- The pinned C++ reference (`8eebea429`) instead indexes `fBuffers[chan]`
  directly and relies on the architecture duplicating channel pointers up to
  `MAX_CHAN` (64, `Soundfile::shareBuffers`). That limit is gone in Rust: a
  soundfile can be read with any number of outputs.
- Runtime contract (the C++ branch's `Soundfile.h`): `fChannels >= 1`, and
  `fBuffers` holds at least `fChannels` pointers. A `Soundfile` that
  duplicates pointers still works; one with `fChannels == 0` divides by zero
  (no guard, as in C++).
- Rust-only host contracts that change with it: the Rust backend's host
  `Soundfile` type must expose `fChannels: i32`, the Julia one
  `fChannels::Int32`, and an AssemblyScript host must provide the import
  `env._soundfileChannels(slot): i32`. The interpreter encodes the field as
  `kLoadSoundFieldInt` with selector 2, which pops no part, and its
  `Soundfile::read_sample` no longer wraps (faust-rs `.fbc` was already not
  interchangeable with C++).
- Compatibility impact: generated code now requires `fChannels` to be set
  correctly, which every C++ runtime does but not faustwasm before its
  matching release. Code generated earlier, run against a runtime that no
  longer duplicates channels, reads out of bounds.
- The impulse fixtures follow the C++ branch's `TestMemoryReader`: each
  channel has its own phase (`sin(part + chan + ...)`) and only the real
  channels are provided. The `sound` reference therefore has to be produced by
  a C++ compiler and `tests/impulse-tests/archs` from that branch; against the
  pinned checkout, `sound` differs on its odd channels.
- Evidence: `crates/compiler/tests/soundfile_channel_wrap.rs` (a 1-, 2- and
  3-channel soundfile read as 70 outputs by the interpreter, scalar and
  vector; C++ text wraps every channel but 0); the `sound` impulse test on all
  backend lanes.

## 6. Additional backends and delivery forms

### DIFF-BACK-001 — Cranelift

- Status: `extension`.
- `-lang cranelift` and the Cranelift factory/JIT APIs are Rust-native; the
  pinned C++ compiler has no direct Cranelift backend.
- The FFI follows the broad Faust factory lifecycle but intentionally omits or
  adapts LLVM-specific target, IR, machine-code, and object families. Its
  `-mem0` manager is an implemented Rust extension using the shared aligned C
  ABI; there is no direct C++ Cranelift oracle.
- Evidence: [`cranelift-backend-plan-en.md`](cranelift-backend-plan-en.md) and
  [`cranelift-dsp-ffi-parity-matrix-en.md`](cranelift-dsp-ffi-parity-matrix-en.md).

### DIFF-BACK-002 — textual WAT and raw embedded compiler module

- Status: `adapted` / `extension`.
- Rust exposes `-lang wast` from its WASM backend and a standalone
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` compiler module in `crates/wasm-ffi`.
- Textual WAT is rendered from Rust's WASM bytes with `wasmprinter`; it is not a
  byte-for-byte textual-codegen promise against C++. The raw embedded compiler
  module is a Rust delivery extension. Neither form implies full semantic or
  binary-layout parity with the mature C++/Emscripten WASM toolchain.

### DIFF-BACK-003 — backend selector surface

- Status: `narrower` plus extensions.
- The current Rust CLI accepts exactly: `asc`, `c`, `cmajor`, `codebox`,
  `codebox-test`, `cpp`, `cranelift`, `fir`, `interp`, `julia`, `rust`, `wasm`,
  and `wast` (including documented aliases).
- A C++ `-lang` value outside that set is not silently forwarded; it is not a
  Rust CLI backend. Conversely, `cranelift` is Rust-only.
- Several non-primary emitters remain narrower than their mature C++
  counterparts. Generated-code lifecycle compatibility is mandatory where the
  corresponding C++ backend exists, but full long-tail lowering coverage is
  not implied.

### DIFF-BACK-004 — generated C/C++ text is not a byte-identity contract

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust-generated C and C++ preserve the public DSP/architecture contract on
  supported lowering paths, but do not reproduce the reference emitter's
  complete source text byte for byte. The compiler banner/version, formatting,
  declaration layout, helper decomposition, and some internal statement names
  and ordering can differ.
- Compatibility must therefore be judged through lifecycle, metadata, UI,
  arity, compilation, and execution checks rather than a raw whole-file diff.
  Conversely, a matching module-shell signature alone is not evidence of
  numerical equivalence.
- The semantic metadata defects discovered beneath those text differences were
  closed by the C-family metadata transport work recorded in the corpus audit.

### DIFF-BACK-005 — WASM companion JSON always populates `sr_index`

- Status: `extension`.
- The WASM/WAST companion JSON's optional `sr_index` field is part of the
  shared Faust JSON schema (`architecture/faust/gui/JSONUI.h`) and has a real
  reader on the host side (`JSONUIDecoder.h` uses it to read the sample rate
  straight out of WASM linear memory, the same way `ui[*].index` is used for
  widget parameters). The C++ WASM backend never populates it for this
  backend: `WASMCodeContainer::generateJSON()` constructs its `JSONInstVisitor`
  with `sr_index = -1`, and the shared serializer omits the key whenever the
  value is `-1`.
- Rust always fills it with the byte offset of `fSampleRate` in the module's
  memory layout (`WasmMemoryLayout::field_offsets`), because that offset is
  already computed for other struct-layout purposes and costs nothing extra to
  expose. A host reading the field gets a working, schema-conformant answer;
  a host that does not look for it is unaffected either way.
- This is additive, not a narrowing: no C++-documented consumer is broken by
  the extra key, and nothing the C++ JSON promises is missing from the Rust
  JSON. It is recorded here so a byte-level comparison against the C++
  companion JSON does not read the extra key as drift.
- Evidence: `porting/wasm-julia-maturity-diff-gap-005-analysis-and-plan-2026-08-14-en.md`
  (`G5-W4`).

## 7. Public API and representation adaptations

### DIFF-API-001 — owned Rust compiler facade

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust entry points return owned `Result` values and artifact bundles instead
  of exposing the C++ global compiler session, raw factory pointers, or only
  filesystem side effects.
- WASM results include bytes, JSON, compile provenance, and optional warning
  bundles. Auxiliary generation returns a list of owned text/binary artifacts.
- Compatibility impact: semantic outputs are preserved where implemented, but
  Rust signatures and ownership are not source- or ABI-compatible with C++.

### DIFF-API-002 — explicit provenance and diagnostics side tables

- Status: `extension` / `adapted`.
- Signal and FIR outputs carry source-neutral provenance maps; compiler
  diagnostics join those maps with parser source snapshots when rendered.
- C++ commonly stores mutable properties on globally shared trees. Rust keeps
  provenance and analysis results in explicit session-owned structures.
- Compatibility impact: this changes public Rust result types and enables
  richer diagnostics, without changing the intended DSP semantics.

### DIFF-API-003 — Cranelift factory serialization

- Status: `adapted`.
- The Cranelift FFI's bitcode-named persistence surface uses a versioned
  source-backed payload that rebuilds the factory. It is not LLVM bitcode.
  IR/machine/object serialization remains deferred without exported V1 symbols.
- Evidence:
  [`cranelift-dsp-ffi-parity-matrix-en.md`](cranelift-dsp-ffi-parity-matrix-en.md).

### DIFF-API-004 — `libfaust.h` as inline C++ wrappers

- Status: `adapted`.
- The backend-agnostic libfaust API (`generateSHA1`,
  `expandDSPFrom{File,String}`, `generateAuxFilesFrom{File,String}[2]`) is
  exported as C symbols from `crates/libfaust-ffi`; the C++ header
  [`crates/libfaust-ffi/include/libfaust.h`](../crates/libfaust-ffi/include/libfaust.h)
  reproduces the reference signatures as header-only inline wrappers over that
  C ABI.
- This is forced, not chosen: the reference functions take and return
  `std::string`, whose symbols are mangled and whose layout has no stable ABI,
  so Rust cannot export them. `libfaust-box.h` already uses the same shape.
- Each wrapper adopts its returned `const char*` and releases it through
  `freeCMemory` before returning, so no allocation crosses back over the
  boundary and callers see only `std::string`.
- Compatibility impact: source-compatible for C++ callers that include the
  header; not ABI-compatible with a C++ libfaust built from the reference
  sources, since the symbols are the C ones.
- Evidence: `cargo run -p xtask -- libfaust-export-check`, which links and runs
  a C++ client of this header against the built library.

### DIFF-API-005 — alignment-aware `dsp_memory_manager` overloads under `-mem0`

- Status: `adapted`.
- The pinned reference's `dsp_memory_manager` (`architecture/faust/dsp/dsp.h`)
  declares only `allocate(size_t)` and `destroy(void*)`; unlike the Rust-only
  C ABI (`faust_memory_manager` in `crates/ffi-common/include/faust-memory-manager.h`,
  DIFF-CLI-010's M4), it never asks for alignment on `allocate` and never hands
  size/alignment back on `destroy`. Generated C++ under `-mem0` now additionally
  recognizes `allocate(size_t, size_t)` and `destroy(void*, size_t, size_t)` — a
  faust-rs `dsp_memory_manager` extension — and prefers them over the legacy
  overloads whenever the linked header declares them.
- Mechanism: every allocation/destruction call site routes through a
  `faust_mem0_detail::{allocate,destroy}` compile-time dispatch shim (one
  `int`/`long`-tagged SFINAE overload pair per operation) emitted once per
  `-mem0` translation unit. SFINAE probes the static type of
  `dsp_memory_manager`, not the concrete manager subclass, so the choice is
  made once at compile time with no runtime branch. Against the genuine,
  unextended upstream header the probe fails and generated code falls back to
  the legacy one-argument overloads unchanged — this is a strict superset, not
  a replacement, and needs no host-side change to keep compiling.
- A manager may adopt the extension two ways: declare the two additive
  overloads with a body that forwards to the legacy ones (so an existing
  subclass that overrides only `allocate(size_t)`/`destroy(void*)` keeps
  working through the base class's default, exercised by
  `mem0_generated_cpp_compiles_and_clone_is_independent`), or override the
  additive overloads directly to receive the requested alignment up front and
  the original size/alignment pair back on release (exercised by the same
  test's `aligned_manager`, which asserts the legacy overloads are never
  reached). `tests/impulse-tests/archs/faust_mem0.h`'s
  `AuditCppMemoryManager` does the latter, additionally auditing that the
  returned address satisfies the requested alignment and that `destroy`'s size
  argument matches what was recorded at allocation.
- The legacy one-argument overloads are the obsolete path from here on: kept
  for source compatibility with hosts still built against the unextended
  upstream header, and marked as such in the generated comment inside
  `faust_mem0_detail`. New memory managers should implement the alignment-aware
  overloads instead.
- Compatibility impact: none for existing hosts — an unmodified reference
  `dsp_memory_manager` still compiles and runs generated `-mem0` C++ code
  unchanged, proven by
  `mem0_generated_cpp_compiles_against_the_unextended_legacy_manager_header`,
  which defines the header exactly as documented in the reference manual and
  nothing else. Hosts that want the richer contract opt in by declaring the
  two additive overloads; nothing in the generated code requires it.
- Evidence: `crates/codegen/src/backends/cpp/mod.rs`
  (`emit_mem0_detail_namespace`), `tests/impulse-tests/archs/faust_mem0.h`,
  and the three compile-and-run C++ tests named above in
  `crates/codegen/src/backends/cpp/mod.rs`.

### DIFF-API-006 — the complete text of an error, and its typed form, through the C API

- Status: `extension`.
- The reference C API reports a failure through `error_msg`, a buffer the caller
  allocates and whose size is never passed: 4096 bytes by contract. Rust keeps
  that contract exactly (the buffer receives what it received, truncated at
  4095 bytes), because writing more would overflow every existing host. A
  compiler diagnostic does not always fit, and for a syntax error the summary
  the buffer gets is a count.
- Five functions, with no reference counterpart, return the whole text (the
  message, then the rendered diagnostics: location, source snippet, notes,
  fixes) from per-thread storage the library owns, the `dlerror` convention:
  `getCCompleteInterpreterDSPFactoryError`,
  `getCCompleteCraneliftDSPFactoryError`, `getCCompleteDSPError`
  (`libfaust-c.h`), `getCCompleteBoxError`, `getCCompleteSignalError`. The
  pointer is null before the thread's first error, valid until its next one,
  not reset by a success, and must not be freed.
- The C++ wrappers (`interpreter-dsp.h`, `cranelift-dsp.h`, `libfaust.h`) read
  them, so their `std::string& error_msg` holds the complete text, where the
  reference's holds its own one-line message. A host that parses that string
  must not assume one line.
- Four more functions, with no reference counterpart either, return the typed
  form of the same failure, the compiler's complete diagnostics-v2 JSON report
  (codes, byte ranges in each source, facts, fixes with their edits and
  applicability): `getCInterpreterDSPFactoryErrorDiagnostics`,
  `getCCraneliftDSPFactoryErrorDiagnostics`, `getCDSPErrorDiagnostics`,
  `getCBoxErrorDiagnostics`. Same storage and lifetime, with one difference:
  the pointer is null when the last error carried no typed diagnostics, even
  if an earlier one did. The Signal API has none, no failure of it being
  typed. Exporting the report ties the ABI to a document, not to its fields:
  it carries its own `schema_version` (2), fields may be added within a
  version, and a host is told to check the version. The C++ wrappers return it
  as a `std::string`; `faustprobe --error-format json` prints the Cranelift one.
- Compatibility impact: none for a host written against the reference API; the
  functions are additions and the buffer's behavior is unchanged.
- Evidence: `crates/ffi-common/src/complete_error.rs`, the `complete_error`
  tests of the FFI crates (which apply the report's fix and compile the
  result), `cargo run -p xtask -- libfaust-export-check`, and
  the workspace README, "Compile errors".

### DIFF-API-007 — the compiler options a factory constructor honors

- Status: `adapted` (narrower).
- The reference `createDSPFactoryFromFile` / `FromString` hand `argv` to the
  whole compiler command line. The Rust constructors (Cranelift and
  Interpreter), the Wasm `compile_dsp` entry and `generateAuxFiles` read two
  sets from it. The compile options are `faust-rs`'s own declaration,
  `compiler::CompileOptionArgs`, read by `CompileOptionArgs::from_argv` in
  every spelling `faust-rs` accepts: `-pn`, `-double`/`-single`,
  `-vec`/`-vs`/`-lv`, `-ss`, `-mcd`, `-dlt`, `-ct`, `-table-init`,
  `--table-init-sample-rate`, `-bra-tape`, `-ec`, `-os`, `-mem0`. The host
  options are read by `ffi_common::parse_ffi_compile_args`: `-I`, `-cn`,
  `-mem0` and its aliases (with the `-vec` and `-it` conflicts), `--warn`. A
  missing or malformed value is an error, `generateAuxFiles` included.
- Any other option is ignored, where the reference applies it or rejects it.
  Until 2026-09-25 each entry point read its own subset: the constructors
  dropped `-pn`, `-mcd`, `-dlt` and `-ct` (a host asking for another entry
  point got `process` without a word), the Interpreter also `-vec`, `-ss`,
  `-ec` and `-os`, `compile_dsp` everything but `-double`, and
  `generateAuxFiles` kept the default for a malformed value.
- Compatibility impact: a host passing an option outside the declaration gets
  the default behavior for it. Options that describe an output (`-o`,
  `-lang`, `-a`, the dumps) have no effect in either implementation.
- Evidence: `crates/compiler/src/compile_options.rs` (declaration, `argv`
  reading and writing, tests), `crates/ffi-common/src/args.rs` (host options),
  `process_name_delay_and_table_options_reach_the_compiler` in
  `crates/cranelift-ffi/src/factory/tests.rs` (each option changes the FIR),
  `the_compile_options_of_the_argv_reach_the_interp_compiler` in
  `crates/interp-ffi/src/factory.rs`,
  `the_compile_options_of_the_args_reach_the_compiler` in
  `crates/wasm-ffi/src/lib.rs`, `crates/cranelift-ffi/tests/compiler_options_probe.rs`.

### DIFF-API-008 — the `faust` crate, a Rust API over the C API

- Status: `extension`.
- `crates/faust` has no C++ counterpart: a safe Rust API (`Factory`, `Dsp`,
  `Param`, `CompileOptions`) over the Interpreter and Cranelift C entry
  points, which it drives with their exact lifecycle (programs shared by SHA
  key, reference counted). It is one of the two contracts of faust-rs, with
  the C API; `ffi-boundary-check` classifies it as a distribution crate.
- Its methods carry the names of the C++ `dsp` and `dsp_factory` classes
  (`dsp.h`) in snake case, as the `FaustDsp` trait of the Rust architectures
  does (`get_num_inputs`, `instance_clear`, `create_dsp_instance`, ...).
  Where it differs from the C API it wraps: a `Dsp` owns a reference to its
  program and is `Send + Sync`; parameters (`Param`, listed by `Dsp::params`)
  are addressed as `MapUI` addresses them (`set_param_value`, `get_param_value`: by path, shortname or label,
  shortnames computed by a port of `PathBuilder::computeShortNames`) instead
  of a `UI` the host implements, and a bargraph cannot be written; `create_dsp_instance` also
  initialises; `compute` is generic over `f32` and `f64` and converts host
  buffers to the compiled precision, and a `-double` interpreter program exchanges exact `f64`
  samples through `interp_ffi::instance::compute_f64`, which the C API does
  not export; `CompileOptions::args` alone selects `-double` or `-single`,
  and `Factory::precision` reports the backend's compiled width. The former
  `CompileOptions::precision` field was removed after
  [issue #19](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust-rs/issues/19) showed that a
  conflicting flag could make the safe API access buffers and UI zones at
  the wrong width. Existing Rust clients using the field must move their
  precision choice into `args`; C and C++ clients are unaffected.
  `CompileOptions::import_dirs` lists directories first-first,
  where a command line's `-I` puts the last one first (it is emitted
  backwards so the C entry points see the C++ order).
- Compatibility impact: none on C and C++ hosts; a Rust host gets a
  documented, typed API instead of raw pointers.
- Evidence: `crates/faust/tests/api.rs` (both backends, including
  `precision_flags_control_factory_buffers_and_parameter_zones` and
  `import_dirs_are_searched_in_order_and_before_the_file_s_directory`),
  `crates/faust/tests/ddsp.rs`, `crates/faust/tests/allocation.rs`,
  [`docs/embedding-layers-en.md`](../docs/embedding-layers-en.md).

## 8. Internal architectural adaptations

These differences normally preserve Faust semantics, but matter to maintainers
and to consumers of Rust crate APIs.

### DIFF-ARCH-001 — session-owned compiler state

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust replaces C++ `gGlobal`-style shared mutable compiler state with values
  owned by a compiler session and passed across crate boundaries.
- Cancellation, timing, diagnostics, imports, provenance, and lowering options
  are explicit inputs or owned outputs rather than implicit process globals.
- Compatibility impact: concurrent and embedded use has a Rust ownership
  contract; internal C++ globals and their mutation order are not an API to
  reproduce.

### DIFF-ARCH-002 — hash-consed arenas and stable ids

- Status: `adapted`.
- Box, Signal, and FIR structures use arena-owned ids and canonical
  builder/matcher APIs rather than exposing raw `Tree` pointers.
- Analyses that C++ stores as mutable tree properties commonly use explicit
  maps keyed by these ids. Pointer order is therefore not a textual ordering
  oracle; deterministic Rust ordering is used where output stability matters.

### DIFF-ARCH-003 — crate consolidation differs from C++ directories

- Status: `adapted`.
- The port intentionally merges C++ `patternmatcher` responsibilities into
  `eval`, integrates extended math signal nodes into `signals`, and integrates
  parallelization work into `transform`.
- Compatibility impact: source-file/module names and internal linkage are not
  preserved. Public behavior and documented external contracts remain the
  parity targets.

### DIFF-ARCH-004 — fallible typed phase boundaries

- Status: `adapted`.
- Rust phases return typed `Result`/diagnostic values and run FIR verification
  before code generation by default. C++ paths often rely on exceptions,
  mutable error strings, assertions, or later backend validation.
- Compatibility impact: failures can be detected earlier and carry a different
  stage/code while still representing the same invalid source or unsupported
  operation.

### DIFF-ARCH-005 — independent structural checking

- Status: `extension`.
- Scheduling, vector planning, FIR lifecycle, and selected routing artifacts
  have explicit checkers; finite high-risk artifacts may use the repository's
  producer/checker certificate methodology.
- This is additional assurance infrastructure. It is not evidence that the
  Rust implementation is formally proved equivalent to C++.

## 9. Known narrower behavior and exclusions

These entries are differences, not intentional semantic extensions. They must
remain visible until closed or explicitly reclassified.

| ID | Status | Current difference |
|---|---|---|
| DIFF-GAP-001 | `narrower` | Full non-trivial stream-wrapper lowering remains less complete than the mature C++ route; the shared-runtime differential confirms different outputs for `rep_18_stream_wrappers` under impulse, ramp, and sine inputs. |
| DIFF-GAP-004 | `narrower` | `getInfos` and some embedded-compiler/filesystem helper semantics remain partial or adapted. |
| DIFF-GAP-005 | `narrower` | WASM and Julia are functional on validated paths but do not claim the complete semantic, layout, packaging, or upstream impulse-suite maturity of the C++ implementations. The two backends were audited on 2026-08-14 and this blanket entry is now backed by an enumerated inventory (`G5-W1`…`G5-W6`, `G5-J1`…`G5-J7`) in [`wasm-julia-maturity-diff-gap-005-analysis-and-plan-2026-08-14-en.md`](wasm-julia-maturity-diff-gap-005-analysis-and-plan-2026-08-14-en.md). Closed so far: Julia's host-visible description surfaces — `metadata!` and `getJSON` now carry the same content as the reference (`G5-J1`, `G5-J2`, `G5-J3`) — the WASM companion JSON identity entries, `compile_options`/`filename`/`name` now appear in `meta` in C++ key order (`G5-W2`) — `sr_index` (`G5-W4`), which needed no code change, only its own registry entry: `DIFF-BACK-005` — and the impulse status table (`G5-J7`), re-derived on the full 133-DSP corpus (`tests/impulse-tests/README.md` §Status now has a Julia row; see the plan doc's P6 for the `FAUST_CPP` PATH-resolution trap that re-deriving it surfaced). Still open: `G5-W1`, `G5-W3`, `G5-W5`, `G5-W6`, `G5-J4`. This entry may only be removed when the inventory is empty; until then it must point at it. |
| DIFF-GAP-006 | `narrower` | The specialized reverse-time recursive RAD path is disabled; Rust uses `BlockReverseAD` for temporal/recursive AD and still rejects mutable-table, soundfile, and unsupported foreign-function derivatives. |
| DIFF-GAP-007 | `narrower` | The Rust CLI/backend set is smaller than the complete Faust C++ backend catalog; unsupported `-lang` values are rejected. |
| DIFF-GAP-008 | `excluded` | `backend-java` is outside the Rust port target scope. |
| DIFF-GAP-009 | `excluded` | Legacy `-lang ocpp` is outside the Rust port target scope. |
| DIFF-GAP-010 | `narrower` | There is no direct Rust LLVM backend matching the C++ LLVM factory/target/object toolchain; Cranelift is a distinct extension, not a drop-in identity mapping. |
| DIFF-GAP-014 | `narrower` | `rep_19_primitive_family` has different numerical results for the `control`/`enable` wrapper portion under the shared interpreter-runtime differential. |
| DIFF-GAP-015 | `narrower` | `rep_37_table_rwtable_negative_indices` has different numerical behavior for negative read/write table indices. |
| DIFF-GAP-016 | `narrower` | `rep_67_variable_delay_shifted_slider` differs for a variable delay whose shifted slider produces a negative intermediate delay expression. |
| DIFF-GAP-017 | `parity-gap` | A division by a zero that is constant without being a literal when its sequence is evaluated (`z = 0 <: _, !;`), used as a **pattern-matching argument whose value is then unused** (`f(0) = 1; f(n) = 2; process = f(1 / z);`), compiles in Rust and fails in C++ (`ERROR : division by 0 in 1 / 0`): C++ simplifies the argument eagerly and its exception is fatal, Rust folds a pattern argument as an optimization and gives up on this one. With a literal divisor both fail, and wherever the quotient is used (a signal, an iteration count, a route size, a label) Rust reports the division too. Pinned by `a_known_divergence_an_unused_late_zero_division_in_a_pattern_argument` in `crates/compiler/tests/diagnostic_errors.rs`; see `DIFF-BEH-010`. |

The 219-case audit that exposed the now-closed root-ordering, source-identity,
and compilation-metadata gaps and the maintained numerical differential that
confirmed `DIFF-GAP-001` and exposed `DIFF-GAP-014` through `016` are recorded in
[`faust-rs-corpus-difference-audit-2026-08-11-en.md`](faust-rs-corpus-difference-audit-2026-08-11-en.md).

## 10. Maintenance rule

Update this file in the same change whenever any of the following occurs:

1. a new source form, CLI option, backend, FFI function, artifact, warning, or
   diagnostic is added without a 1:1 C++ counterpart;
2. a default, accepted input, lifecycle step, scheduling rule, generated-code
   contract, failure policy, or output representation intentionally differs;
3. a public mapping changes between `1:1`, `adapted`, `deferred`, or excluded;
4. a known gap closes, narrows, expands, or becomes an explicit non-goal;
5. the pinned C++ reference changes and invalidates a comparison here.

For each update:

- add or retain a stable `DIFF-*` identifier;
- state the compatibility impact, not just the implementation detail;
- link the controlling plan, API matrix, test, or corpus fixture;
- distinguish implemented behavior from planned behavior;
- update or remove stale entries when parity is reached;
- record the change in the daily journal.

Reviews of parity-sensitive changes must treat an omitted registry update as a
documentation defect, even when the implementation and tests are otherwise
correct.
