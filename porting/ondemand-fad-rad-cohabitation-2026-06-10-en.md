The consolidated landing order across all documents is the

(this document's phases A/B/C land as roadmap P4/P5/P8).

C++ reference: none for the combination — `fad`/`rad` are faust-rs
primitives with no C++ counterpart, so faust-rs defines the reference
semantics here and validation relies on numerical oracles (§8).

## 1. Goal

Analyze how the faust-rs differentiation primitives (`fad(expr, seed)`
forward mode, `rad(expr, seeds)` reverse mode) interact with clock
domains: what works today, what fails and *how* it fails, what the
correct mathematics is, and in what order to build the combination.

## 2. Why cohabitation matters (use cases)

The flagship use cases of FAD are **in-graph learning loops**
(`ad.lib`: `ad.grad`, `ad.fit_adam`, `ad.fit_rmsprop`, `ad.dense`,
`ad.newton`; corpus: `fad_filter3.dsp`, `fad_pendulum_cello4.dsp`, the
`auto_*` adaptive effects). Today every optimizer step runs **at audio
rate** — one Adam update per sample. The clock-domain primitives are
precisely the missing tool to make these loops cheap — and, in the other
direction, FAD is what makes the clocked blocks *adaptive*. Concretely:

**1. Control-rate in-graph learning.** Gradients may be cheap, but the
optimizer (`ad.fit_adam`: moments, clipping, clamping — per parameter) is
pure overhead at audio rate. Clock the update step every N samples; the
`PermVar` sample-and-hold output is *exactly* the right semantics for a
parameter held between updates:

```faust
upd = ba.pulse(64);                       // update clock, ~690 Hz at 44.1 kHz
p = tick ~ _ with {
  tick(prev) = (upd, prev) : ondemand(adam) with {
    adam(q) = ad.fit_adam(q, p_init, err, ad.grad(loss(q), q), lr, mn, mx);
  };
};
```

**2. Event-triggered adaptation.** With a *boolean* clock, `ondemand`
gates learning on a runtime condition. The canonical case: adapt only
while signal is present — today's `auto_*` effects keep optimizing on
noise during silence and drift away from the learned optimum:

```faust
active = an.amp_follower(0.05, x) > 0.001;   // freeze learning in silence
p = tick ~ _ with { tick(prev) = (active, prev) : ondemand(fit); };
```

The same shape covers feedback-killer notch tuning that runs only while
a larsen detector fires (`auto_notch_larsen.dsp`), envelope-triggered
re-calibration (`fad_calib1.dsp`), and one-shot system identification
("learn while the test signal plays, then hold forever").

**3. Decimated gradient estimation.** `downsampling(H)` around the
loss+gradient computation evaluates the gradient on every H-th sample —
a stochastic sub-sampled gradient, the in-graph analogue of minibatch
SGD. For block-based adaptive filters (`fad_fxlms*.dsp`, active noise
control) this matches how real LMS/FxLMS systems update. Bonus for
reverse mode: a decimated loss shrinks the `SigBlockReverseAD` tape and
the reverse-sweep cost by the same factor H (§7).

**4. Frame-rate DDSP controllers.** The neural helpers (`ad.dense`,
`ad.gru_cell`, `ad.lstm_cell`) run per-sample today, which is wildly
expensive and not even what DDSP architectures prescribe: control
networks run at *frame* rate (every 64–256 samples) and drive an
audio-rate synth through held/smoothed parameters. That is literally
`downsampling(controller)` + `PermVar` hold (+ `si.smooth` outside the
domain for de-zippering). `fad_pendulum_cello4.dsp` restructured this
way is the natural showcase.

**5. Runtime-count implicit solvers.** `upsampling(H)` executes its body
H times per outer tick with recursive state crossing the inner
iterations — i.e. it is an **in-graph iteration construct**. Newton
solvers with `fad`-computed Jacobians currently unroll a *static*
iteration count (`ad.newton(model, y0, K) = seq(i, K, newton_step)`).
Under `upsampling` the count becomes a *runtime signal*:

```faust
k = 1 + min(7, int(residual / tol));      // adaptive iteration count
y = (k, x) : upsampling(newton_step)      // newton_step uses fad(F, y)
```

— more iterations only when the implicit equation (diode clipper,
Duffing oscillator: `fad_diode_gemini.dsp`, `fad_duffing_gemini.dsp`) is
far from convergence. No static unrolling can express this.

**6. Lower oversampling factors via exact slopes (ADAA +
derivative-augmented decimation).** Two distinct mechanisms stack inside
`upsampling(H)`, and only the second one is FAD's contribution:

- *Classical ADAA* (antiderivative antialiasing, Parker et al. 2016)
  already trades oversampling for algebra — first-order ADAA plus ×2
  oversampling typically reaches the alias floor of plain ×8. But its
  ingredient is the **antiderivative** `F`, which FAD does *not*
  provide (FAD differentiates, it does not integrate): `F` must be
  supplied in closed form (`tanh` → `log(cosh)`, hard clip → piecewise
  quadratic).
- *Derivative-augmented decimation* is where `fad` earns its keep. By
  the generalized (Papoulis) sampling theorem, sampling value **plus
  first derivative** at rate R carries the information of value-only
  sampling at 2R. Computing both `y = f(x)` and `ẏ = f′(x)·ẋ` in the
  inner domain — `f′` exact via `fad(f(x), x)` (FAD skill pattern 2),
  `ẋ` from an inner-rate first difference or analytically for
  synthesized signals — lets a Hermite-reconstruction decimator target
  **H/2 instead of H** for the same alias floor.

Exact slopes additionally locate `f′` discontinuities for BLAMP-style
corner corrections (hard nonlinearities, whose ~1/k² harmonic rolloff
makes brute-force oversampling inefficient), and supply the Newton
Jacobians of case 5 for *implicit* nonlinearities (diode clipper), where
oversampling demands are worst. Honest caveats: none of this
*eliminates* aliasing — `f(x(t))` is not bandlimited, these techniques
lower the floor, and the gain tracks the harmonic rolloff of the
nonlinearity; the H/2 figure is a theoretical ceiling that assumes the
outer-domain decimator actually exploits the derivative channel (a
Hermite reconstruction filter after the bare `PermVar` hold, built in
the outer domain from the held `y` and `ẏ` lanes); and the `ma.SR`
adaptation inside US (plan §2.3) is what keeps time-constant-dependent
formulas correct at `SR·H`.

**7. Multi-timescale (nested) optimization.** Domains nest: an inner
`ondemand` adapts the DSP parameters every 64 samples, an outer (slower)
`ondemand` adapts *hyperparameters* — learning-rate decay on loss
plateau, gradient-clipping bounds — every 8192 samples. This is the
in-graph form of an optimization schedule, expressed as two nested clock
domains; today's host-driven pattern (FAD skill pattern 7) exists partly
because slow schedules have nowhere to live in the graph.

Note the staging payoff (§6): every pattern above except boundary-
crossing variants of 3 places `fad` **strictly inside one domain** —
Phase A. The killer use cases are reachable as soon as the base port
lands, before any cross-boundary AD work.

So the combination FAD × OD/US/DS is the natural completion of both
features, and the port plan should treat it as a roadmap item, not a
corner case.

## 3. Where the two features meet in the pipeline

Both are **propagation-stage** expansions over the same signal DAG:

- `ondemand/upsampling/downsampling` expand in `propagate_clocked_wrapper`
  ([engine.rs:840-915](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/engine.rs)) into
  the boundary glue (`TempVar`/`double_clocked`/`ZeroPad` in,
  `PermVar`/`Clocked` out, `Seq(blockNode, permvar)` results).
- `fad` expands in the `FlatNodeKind::ForwardAD` arm
  ([engine.rs:648-677](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/engine.rs)):
  seeds are propagated first, then the body, then
  `forward_ad::generate_fad_signals_multi` rewrites the body DAG into
  interleaved `[primal, tangent…]` lanes. `rad` follows the same wiring and
  dispatches to a symbolic feed-forward sweep or to the `SigBlockReverseAD`
  tape carrier ([reverse_ad.rs](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/reverse_ad.rs)).

Consequently, whichever construct is syntactically *inner* is expanded
first:

- **`fad` inside an OD body**: the fad body and seeds are propagated under
  the inner clock env (`ctx.clock_env = clock_env2` is active across
  `propagate_in_slot_env(body, …)`). The tangent lanes built by
  `forward_ad` are ordinary arithmetic over inner-domain signals; the
  bottom-up clock inference of plan §3.6 will place them in the inner domain
  automatically. **No new inference rule is needed** — a direct benefit of
  the "env of a signal is determined only by its inputs" property (plan §4.1).
- **`fad` around an OD wrapper**: by the time `generate_fad_signals_multi`
  runs, the body signals already contain
  `Seq(OD, PermVar(Clocked(c, y)))` shapes, so the forward-AD transform
  meets the glue nodes head-on. This is where the current implementation
  is wrong (next section).

A seed is matched by **node identity** (hash-consed `SigId`). A slider
used both outside and inside a domain is the *same* node (UI elements are
not slot-bound, so they receive no `Clocked` wrapper), so seed matching
works across the boundary as-is. The C++ `recTempVar` stacking for
slot-bound signals (plan §3.2) is the one mechanism that may *rename* a signal
between domains; the FAD seed-identity contract must be re-checked when
that part is ported.

## 4. Current behavior (validated experimentally, 2026-06-10, `main-dev`)

| Program | Result today |
|---|---|
| `ondemand` alone | `FRS-SFIR-0004` (the plan §6.3 `signal_prepare` bug — clock env traversed as a signal) |
| `fad( … : ondemand(*(g)), g)` | propagation **succeeds silently** (zero tangents), then dies at the same unrelated `FRS-SFIR-0004` |
| `ondemand(fad(*(g), g))` | same: silent propagation, then `FRS-SFIR-0004` |
| `rad( … : ondemand(*(g)), g)` | `FRS-PROP-0001 — rad cannot differentiate signal node (other)` — loud and correct, but the message does not name `ondemand` |

The mechanism behind the silent `fad` cases is the catch-all in
[forward_ad.rs:1075](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/forward_ad.rs):
`Seq`, `Clocked`, `TempVar`, `PermVar`, `ZeroPad`, `OnDemand`,
`Upsampling`, `Downsampling` all fall through to `zero_tangent(sig)` —
primal preserved, **every tangent lane silently zero, children not
traversed**. RAD instead rejects loudly by design
([reverse_ad.rs:322-334](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/reverse_ad.rs));
note that `stateful_rad`'s classifier already treats the glue
conservatively and correctly skips the clock-env child of `Clocked`
([stateful_rad.rs:625,818](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/stateful_rad.rs)).

**The correctness cliff.** Today the unrelated `FRS-SFIR-0004` failure
masks the zero-tangent bug. The moment base-port Step 1 fixes
`signal_prepare`, `fad`-across-a-boundary will *compile and run with
silently wrong (zero) gradients* — the worst failure mode for a learning
loop, which will simply not converge. Therefore: **a FAD diagnostic on
boundary glue must land in the same step as the `signal_prepare` fix**
(see §8).

There is no upstream reference for this combination: `fad`/`rad` are
faust-rs primitives with no C++ counterpart, so faust-rs gets to define
the reference semantics, and validation must rely on numerical oracles
(§8) rather than differential testing.

## 5. The mathematics: differentiation commutes with the boundary

Fix a parameter (seed) θ and assume **the clock H does not depend on θ**.
Then every boundary operator is *linear time-varying with
θ-independent timing*, and differentiation commutes with all of them:

| Boundary operator | Forward sample semantics | Tangent rule |
|---|---|---|
| snapshot (`TempVar` + `double_clocked`) | read `u[n]` at the fire instant | `(snap u)' = snap(u')` |
| hold (`PermVar`, init 0) | `y[n] = u[τ(n)]`, `τ(n)` = last fire ≤ n | `(hold u)' = hold(u')` — S&H commutes with d/dθ |
| zero-pad (`ZeroPad(u, H)`, US input) | `u` on last inner iteration, else 0 | `(pad u)' = pad(u')`, `H` not differentiated |
| per-domain time (local `IOTA`) | inner delays advance only on fire | tangent state interleaved in the *same* rec groups fires on the same clock — primal/tangent automatically co-clocked |
| init | `PermVar` starts at 0 | consistent: before the first fire, primal = 0 *and* tangent = 0 |

The interleaved augmented-state recursion model that FAD already uses
(one carrier `[primal, d/ds0, …]` per rec group) pays off here: because
tangent state lives in the same recursive group as primal state, both
advance under the same clock with the same local `IOTA` *by
construction* — there is no way for them to de-synchronize.

**If the clock does depend on θ** (e.g. a comparator on a learned
signal): the firing *times* move with θ and the exact derivative gains
Dirac-like terms at firing boundaries. Policy: ignore them — the clock is
non-differentiable discrete control, exactly like the existing `select2`
selector and `int_cast` rules (zero tangent through the condition). This
is a documented approximation boundary, not a bug.

Conclusion: the exact forward rule is **purely structural** —
differentiate the body in its own domain and duplicate the boundary
machinery for the tangent lanes under the *same clock env*:

```
fad(ondemand(C), s)  ≡  ondemand(C_aug)     C_aug emits [primal lanes, tangent lanes]
```

and identically for `upsampling`/`downsampling`.

## 6. FAD design: block augmentation ("augment once")

Concrete `transform()` rules for `forward_ad.rs` (Phase B below):

| Node | Dual rule |
|---|---|
| `TempVar(u)` | primal unchanged; tangent `TempVar(u')` |
| `Clocked(c, u)` | `Clocked(c, u')` — the clock-env child is opaque, **never traversed** (same invariant as the Step-1 `signal_prepare` fix) |
| `double_clocked(c2, c1, u)` | `double_clocked(c2, c1, u')` |
| `ZeroPad(u, H)` | `ZeroPad(u', H)` |
| `PermVar(u)` | `PermVar(u')` |
| `Seq(OD, y)` | `Dual { primal: Seq(OD_aug, y), tangent: Seq(OD_aug, y') }` |
| `OD/US/DS(clockedClock, Y…)` | `OD_aug` = same kind, same clocked clock, payload `Y ∪ Y'` — built **once per source block node** (memoized) |

Design constraints discovered by this analysis:

1. **One block, not two.** All `Seq(OD, …)` consumers must be rebuilt to
   point at `OD_aug`. If the original block node stayed reachable next to
   the augmented one, a *stateful* body (delays, recursion) would execute
   twice per fire and its local `IOTA`/state would advance twice — wrong.
   Memoizing the OD→OD_aug rewrite per source node (the transform is
   already memoized per `SigId`) and routing every `Seq` through it gives
   this for free; the original node becomes unreachable garbage in the
   arena.
2. **Clock-env identity is reused, and that is legal.** `OD_aug` carries
   the same `clock_env2`; inner-domain signals keep their env; inference
   sees one domain whose subgraph key is `OD_aug`. This also validates the
   plan §5.3 `ClockDomain` side-table recommendation: block augmentation
   rewrites *signal* nodes only and must never have to re-mint a domain
   identity.
3. **Tangent lanes terminate at the boundary by recursion into the outer
   domain**: `(snap u)' = snap(u')` re-enters `transform(u)` in the outer
   DAG, so a chain `fad(g*_ : ondemand(F), g)` correctly picks up the
   `∂(g·x)/∂g` contribution that today is silently dropped.
4. **`suppress_fad`/`RecFadMode::ExpandAfterRec` interplay** (the deferred
   FAD expansion used when `fad` sits under a `Rec` branch,
   [engine.rs:551-621](RUST/faust-rs/crates/propagate/src/engine.rs)): if a
   clocked wrapper sits between the `Rec` and the suppressed `fad`,
   `pending_fad_seeds` cross a domain boundary. The deferred expansion
   then runs on outputs that contain glue nodes — Phase B rules cover it,
   but this nesting needs a dedicated test (and a diagnostic until then).

**Staging.** Phase A — `fad` strictly inside one domain (seed = slider or
domain-local signal, differentiated path never crosses the boundary) —
needs **zero new FAD code**: the tangent DAG is domain-local arithmetic
and the base-port Steps 1–6 carry it like any other inner signal. It
needs tests, plus the boundary diagnostic so that accidental crossings
fail loudly instead of converging to nothing. Phase B is the table above.

## 7. RAD: the transpose of a clock domain

Reverse mode is harder for a structural reason: **the adjoints of the
boundary operators are their transposes**, and transposition swaps the
boundary roles (classic multirate identities):

| Forward operator | Transpose (adjoint propagation) |
|---|---|
| hold (`PermVar`) `y[n] = u[τ(n)]` | `ū[k] = Σ_{n: τ(n)=k} ȳ[n]` — **accumulate over the hold period, deposit at the fire instant** |
| zero-pad (US input) | sample at the last inner iteration (decimation) |
| snapshot (sampling at fires) | impulse placement: adjoint deposits only at fire instants |
| upsampling block `US(B)` | downsampling-with-accumulation of `Bᵀ` |
| downsampling block `DS(B)` | upsampling-with-zero-stuffing of `Bᵀ` |
| `ondemand(B)` | `ondemand(Bᵀ)` on the same firing pattern with hold↔accumulate swapped at its boundaries |

Within the existing `SigBlockReverseAD` tape architecture the picture is
clean: running the block tape *backwards*, the adjoint of `ondemand` is a
**gated integrate-and-dump** — accumulate `ȳ` while scanning the hold
period in reverse, and on reaching a recorded fire instant, push the
accumulator through the transposed body and deposit into `ū`. The costs:

- the tape must become **clock-aware**: record the evaluated clock per
  outer tick (firing pattern) and use variable-rate storage for inner
  intermediates (×H entries per outer tick under US, ÷H under DS);
- per-domain reverse time: the backward sweep must respect each domain's
  local time, i.e. the tape needs per-domain time stamps.

The YOLO linearize-once/transpose path
(`porting/yolo-linearize-once-rad-analysis-2026-05-21-en.md`) gets the
*constant-rate* cases almost for free: with frozen controls and constant
integer `H`, US/DS blocks are linear **periodically**-time-varying, and
the transpose is the static block swap of the table above. `ondemand`
with a data-dependent boolean clock is genuinely LTV with a
data-dependent schedule — only the tape route covers it.

Recommendation: keep the loud rejection (already the current behavior —
the right call), but **improve the message** to name the construct
(today: kind `"other"`; it should say `ondemand/upsampling/downsampling
inside rad is not supported yet`). Implement the clock-aware tape only
after base-port Step 6 and FAD Phase B have proven the forward
semantics; the LPTV transpose for constant-rate US/DS can come last as an
optimization.

## 8. Sequencing and test corpus

Order of work (interleaved with the base plan (plan §7)):

1. **With Step 1** (same change set): FAD diagnostic on boundary glue —
   replace the silent `zero_tangent` fallback for
   `Seq/Clocked/TempVar/PermVar/ZeroPad/OD/US/DS` with a structured
   `FRS-PROP` error ("fad cannot yet differentiate across an
   ondemand/upsampling/downsampling boundary"). Removes the correctness
   cliff of §4. Also improve the RAD `"other"` message (one-liner).
2. **After base Steps 1–6**: FAD Phase A — corpus + runtime tests for
   `fad` strictly inside a domain (control-rate `ad.fit_adam` under
   `ondemand`, oversampled slope under `upsampling`).
3. **FAD Phase B**: block augmentation per §6; relax the diagnostic.
4. **RAD Phase C**: clock-aware tape; then optionally the LPTV transpose.

Corpus additions (note: **no differential testing against C++ is possible
here** — upstream has no `fad`; the oracle is the finite-difference
harness already used by `fad_recursive_runtime.rs` / `rad_runtime.rs` /
`block_reverse_ad.rs`):

- `fad` inside `ondemand`, slider seed (Phase A happy path);
- control-rate Adam: `ondemand(fit_adam_step)` with a pulse clock,
  convergence test vs audio-rate reference (§2 case 1);
- event-gated learning: boolean clock from a level detector, asserting
  parameters freeze exactly during silence (§2 case 2);
- runtime-count Newton under `upsampling` with a signal-valued iteration
  count, vs the statically unrolled `ad.newton` reference (§2 case 5);
- `fad` inside `upsampling` (exact slope), tangent vs finite differences
  at the oversampled rate, plus an alias-floor measurement comparing
  value-only decimation at H against derivative-augmented (Hermite)
  decimation at H/2 (§2 case 6);
- `fad` around `ondemand` with the seed feeding the wrapper *input*
  (boundary crossing: diagnostic in step 1, exact value in Phase B);
- seed = the clock itself, and clock-depends-on-seed (documented
  zero/approximation, must not crash);
- `ondemand` nested in `ondemand` under one `fad` (env reuse + block
  augmentation at two depths);
- `fad` under `Rec` with a clocked wrapper in between
  (`suppress_fad` interplay, §6 point 4);
- `rad` around each wrapper kind (diagnostic snapshot until Phase C).
