  Lean 4 specification for:

    vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md

  Scope
  -----
  This file mechanizes the finite structural core of section 5:

  * signal decorations and representative typing rules;
  * dependency graphs with consumer -> dependency edges;
  * valid schedule certificates and an executable certificate checker;
  * the four public scheduling strategy tags;
  * the ordered C++ needSeparateLoop decision;
  * effects, placement, epochs, and typed transports;
  * region-aware lowering and fission/simulation proof obligations;
  * abstract delay and repeated-transition semantics.

  It deliberately does not claim a proof of the complete Faust compiler.
  FissionSafe, schedule independence, and scalar/vector simulation are exposed
  as propositions that later implementation-specific developments must prove.

  This file uses only Lean's bundled Std library. It contains no `sorry` and no
  axioms. Validate it with:

      lean porting/vector-mode-scheduling-formal-spec.lean

  How to read this file
  ---------------------
  Lean distinguishes programs from propositions, but both are ordinary terms:

  * definitions returning `Bool`, such as `verifySchedule`, are executable;
  * definitions returning `Prop`, such as `ValidSchedule`, state contracts;
  * a `theorem` supplies a checked proof of a proposition;
  * a proof-valued structure field, such as `Scheduler.sound`, is an obligation
    that every future implementation must fill before Lean accepts it.

  Consequently, the file proves the algebraic and finite checker lemmas that do
  not depend on faust-rs, while representing compiler-specific correctness as
  explicit interfaces. Merely compiling this file does not prove the current
  Rust compiler correct; it proves that this specification is well typed, has
  no admitted facts, and that every theorem body is accepted by Lean's kernel.

  Naming conventions
  ------------------
  Names ending in `B` return `Bool` and can be evaluated. Their proposition-level
  wrappers use equality with `true`. Graph edges always point from a consumer to
  one of its dependencies. Thus a dependency must occur before its consumer in
  a valid execution order.

abbrev EpochId := Nat

/-
  Identifiers are natural numbers because the porting plan requires stable,
  deterministic allocation. They are aliases, not distinct runtime wrappers:
  the model focuses on semantics rather than Rust representation details.
-/

/-! ## Analysis domains -/

/-
  `Rate` is the three-point variability lattice used by the signal analysis:

      Konst < Block < Samp

  `join` computes the least upper bound. The three following theorems establish
  the semilattice laws needed to combine operand analyses independently of
  traversal grouping.
-/

  | konst
  | block
  | samp
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

  | .samp, _ => .samp
  | _, .samp => .samp

  | .samp => false
  | _ => true

  cases a <;> cases b <;> cases c <;> rfl

theorem join_idem (a : Rate) : join a a = a := by
  cases a <;> rfl

end Rate

inductive Vectorability where
  | vect
  | scal
  | trueScal
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

namespace Vectorability

/-
  Vectorability is ordered from least to most restrictive:

      Vect < Scal < TrueScal

  A parent inherits the strongest restriction of its children. `TrueScal`
  denotes an operation whose semantics intrinsically require scalar execution;
  `Scal` may still participate in a serial island inside a vector plan.
-/

def join : Vectorability -> Vectorability -> Vectorability
  | .trueScal, _ => .trueScal
  | _, .trueScal => .trueScal
  | .scal, _ => .scal
  | _, .scal => .scal
  | .vect, .vect => .vect

theorem join_comm (a b : Vectorability) : join a b = join b a := by
  cases a <;> cases b <;> rfl

theorem join_assoc (a b c : Vectorability) :
    join (join a b) c = join a (join b c) := by
  cases a <;> cases b <;> cases c <;> rfl

end Vectorability

inductive ValueTy where
  | int
  | real
  | tuple (components : List ValueTy)
  deriving Repr

def promoteNumeric : ValueTy -> ValueTy -> Option ValueTy
  | .int, .int => some .int
  | .int, .real => some .real
  | .real, .int => some .real
  | .real, .real => some .real
  | _, _ => none

/-
  This deliberately small value-type universe is sufficient to state the
  scheduling invariants. `none` makes an invalid numeric combination explicit
  instead of silently inventing a coercion. Backend-specific widths and
  `FaustFloat` lowering belong to the FIR refinement of this model.
-/

inductive Purity where
  | pure
  | impure
  | unknown
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

inductive Resource where
  | state (id : Nat)
  | table (id : Nat)
  | ui (id : Nat)
  | output (channel : Nat)
  | foreign (name : String)
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

inductive Effect where
  | read (resource : Resource)
  | write (resource : Resource)
  | foreignCall (name : String) (purity : Purity)
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

namespace Effect

/-
  `conflicts a b` is a conservative dependence test. Two reads commute. Accesses
  to different resources commute. A write conflicts with another access to the
  same resource. Pure foreign calls add no ordering edge, while impure or unknown
  calls conflict conservatively because the model cannot inspect their effects.
-/

def conflicts : Effect -> Effect -> Bool
  | .foreignCall _ .pure, _ => false
  | _, .foreignCall _ .pure => false
  | .foreignCall _ _, _ => true
  | _, .foreignCall _ _ => true
  | .read _, .read _ => false
  | .read a, .write b => decide (a = b)
  | .write a, .read b => decide (a = b)
  | .write a, .write b => decide (a = b)

/-
  `conflicts` is used as a symmetric commutation test, so its symmetry is a
  required property rather than an incidental one. The resource comparison uses
  `decide (a = b)` on `DecidableEq Resource`, which makes the symmetry provable
  from `eq_comm` instead of relying on an unproved `BEq` law.

def effectsCommute (left right : List Effect) : Bool :=
  left.all fun a => right.all fun b => !(Effect.conflicts a b)

/-
  Pairwise commutation is the condition for leaving two incomparable loops
  unordered. If this check is false, planning must add an effect edge, merge the
  operations, or place them in a serial island.

structure Decoration where
  valueTy : ValueTy
  rate : Rate
  vectorability : Vectorability
  clock : ClockId
  effects : List Effect
  deriving Repr

/-
  A decoration is the product judgment attached to a prepared signal. Keeping
  type, rate, vectorability, clock, and effects together prevents later passes
  from making locally inconsistent scheduling decisions.
-/

/-! ## Representative signal typing judgment -/

/-
  `HasType expression decoration` is an inductively generated judgment. A value
  exists only when one constructor proves it. These constructors are a compact,
  representative subset of Faust signals rather than a replacement AST:

  * literals and inputs introduce base facts;
  * `bin` joins rates and vectorability after checking clocks and promotion;
  * `delay` records both the state read and state write;
  * `proj` preserves recursion-group effects but forces scalar treatment;
  * `clocked` changes only the explicit clock domain.

  Adding a real signal node requires adding a constructor whose conclusion
  states all five decoration components, making omissions visible to Lean.
-/

inductive Expr where
  | intLit (value : Int)
  | realLit (value : Float)
  | input (channel : Nat)
  | bin (left right : Expr)
  | delay (value amount : Expr) (state : Resource)
  | proj (index : Nat) (group : Expr)
  | clocked (clock : ClockId) (value : Expr)
  deriving Repr

/-
  Base signals live in a fixed root clock domain. This is what makes the typing
  judgment a total *function* of the expression: earlier drafts let each literal
  and input carry a free `clock`, so a single expression admitted many judgments
  and the companion document's `Totality` claim ("exactly one judgment exists")
  was false. `Clocked` is the sole clock-changing constructor, and
  `hasType_functional` below now proves determinism.

/-
  `delay` deliberately over-approximates: it emits `ReadState`/`WriteState` for
  every delay, including the `n = 0` case the companion document says "may
  discharge its state effects." Over-approximation is the sound direction for
  scheduling (it can only add ordering constraints), and this constructor cannot
  inspect the amount, so the discharge is left to the concrete delay analysis.

  `hasType_functional` establishes the `Totality`/uniqueness property: the
  representative judgment assigns at most one decoration to any expression. The
  proof inducts on the first derivation and inverts the second; each expression
  head admits a single constructor, and every decoration component is fixed
  either by a sub-derivation (via the induction hypothesis) or by a function
  (`promoteNumeric`, list projection).

  `Expr` and `HasType` document representative rules; faust-rs must not rebuild
  its production forest in this miniature AST. The structures below are the
  actual cross-language boundary: one record is exported for every reachable
  prepared `SigId`, together with the labelled dependencies used by planning.

/-
  A concrete `verifyDecorations` must additionally validate each record against
  the authoritative type, clock, occurrence, delay, and effect analyses. Those
  compiler-specific maps are intentionally parameters of the future checker,
  not axioms asserted by this standalone specification.
-/

/-! ## Dependency graph and schedule certificates -/

/-
  `DependencyGraph Node` is finite because `nodes` is a list. For a consumer
  `u`, `dependencies u` lists every `v` required by `u`; this is the C++ Faust
  edge convention `u -> v`. A well-formed adapter must list every dependency in
  `nodes`. The schedule checker detects an omitted endpoint because such a node
  cannot be found in the proposed order.

  `BEq` provides executable equality and `LawfulBEq` proves that this Boolean
  equality agrees with Lean equality. Requiring both avoids certificates built
  with a pathological comparison function.
-/

/-
  A schedule covers a graph exactly when it is a duplicate-free permutation of
  `graph.nodes`. The two `all` clauses check both inclusions instead of assuming
  that equal list lengths imply equality of finite sets.

  `noDuplicatesB graph.nodes` is required as well: without it a graph whose node
  list contained duplicates would be "covered" by its deduplicated order, so the
  reference checker would be strictly weaker than the Rust R1 checker (which
  demands unique nodes). Both inclusions plus both `Nodup` facts give a genuine
  set bijection, matched below by `CoversRel`.

  The predicates and lemmas below supply the missing semantic anchor: an
  independently stated relational meaning of "valid schedule", and a proof that
  the Boolean checker is both sound and complete against it. This is what makes
  `verifySchedule` a trustworthy reference oracle rather than a tautology.

/-
  The `run` field is a total Lean function, so termination is part of the
  implementation boundary. `sound` and `complete` are the S-Sound and
  S-Complete obligations. Determinism follows from `run` being a function.

  This structure is an L4 refinement target for a future mechanized scheduler;
  it is not a structure that the progressive Rust port must construct. The
  production L2 path is `run candidate -> certify? candidate`: Rust may use an
  ordinary scheduler, but no candidate reaches lowering unless the independent
  checker constructs a `ScheduleCertificate`. Proving `Scheduler.complete`
  concerns the producer and does not change or weaken that trust boundary.

  `SignalFacts` contains only the inputs used by the C++ `needSeparateLoop`
  decision. The nested `if` expression is normative: it preserves first-match
  priority rather than treating the conditions as an unordered Boolean formula.
  In particular, a positive delayed use always creates a loop, even for a very
  simple or slow signal.

  `separateLoop_complete` exhausts the finite Boolean/rate cases after splitting

/-! ## Placement, epochs, transports, and vector-plan certificates -/

/-
  Placement separates ownership from execution order:

  * `control` is materialized in a fixed slower/lifecycle region;
  * `inline` may be rebuilt in several loops, but only when duplicable;
  * `owned loop` has one materialized producer loop.

  Loop kind records whether a loop may use vector FIR, must preserve a recursive
  group's serial semantics, or is a serial clock/effect island.
-/

  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

structure ExecutionEpoch where
  id : EpochId
  rank : Nat
  loops : List LoopId
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-
  Epochs are fixed semantic phases, for example forward and reverse AD passes.
  `id` is stable identity; `rank` is execution order. Scheduling may reorder
  loops inside an epoch but must never reorder or interleave epochs.
-/

structure Transport where
  signal : SigId
  producer : LoopId
  consumer : LoopId
  elementTy : ValueTy
  length : Nat
  deriving Repr

/-
  A transport is the explicit chunk-local storage required when an owned signal
  is consumed by another loop. Its element type must match the signal type and
  its array length must equal the vector chunk size.
-/

def Transport.WellTyped (typeOf : SigId -> ValueTy) (vecSize : Nat)
    (transport : Transport) : Prop :=
  transport.producer ≠ transport.consumer

    (lower : vindex ≤ i0) (upper : i0 < vindex + vecSize) :
    chunkIndex i0 vindex < vecSize := by
  simp [chunkIndex]
  omega

/-
  `chunkIndex_lt` proves the array-safety part of `j = i0 - vindex`: when `i0`
  lies in the current half-open chunk `[vindex, vindex + vecSize)`, `j` is a
  valid transport index. The lower bound also prevents truncated subtraction
  from hiding an invalid sample position.
-/

/-- A signal is duplicable when re-evaluating it in another region at the same
    logical sample yields identical bits and observations. Sufficient structural
    condition used here: its aggregated effect set contains only pure foreign
    calls — no state/table/UI/output read or write, and no impure/unknown call.
    Because effects propagate to parents (see `HasType`), this also discharges
    the "recursively duplicable operands" requirement. It is conservative: it may
    reject a genuinely duplicable signal, but never accepts a non-duplicable one,
    so `P-Duplicate` can never be satisfied vacuously. -/

  rootHasOwner : ∀ signal loop,

/-
  `VectorPlan` is the strategy-independent result of signal-level analysis.
  Proof fields enforce local construction invariants immediately:

  * an inline signal is duplicable (checked against its effects, not asserted);
  * roots contain no duplicates within a loop;
  * ownership and root membership agree in both directions.

  Duplicability and vectorization-safety are no longer opaque `Prop` parameters
  (which could be discharged by `fun _ => True`). They are *defined* below from
  the per-signal `effects` and `vectorability` data the analysis actually
  produces, so the corresponding invariants have real content.

  Functions such as `signalType`, `placement`, and `loopKind` stand for immutable
  tables in the Rust implementation. The absence of `SchedulingStrategy` is
  intentional and makes P-Strategy visible in the type itself.

def VectorPlan.Duplicable (plan : VectorPlan) (s : SigId) : Prop :=
  duplicableEffectsB (plan.effects s) = true

/-- `VecSafe` content (a conservative sufficient condition): every materialized
    root of the loop is locally vectorizable and carries no cross-sample state
    effect. This can classify more loops as unsafe than C++, which is the sound

/-
  `epochGraph` is the induced graph scheduled by `-ss`: it keeps only edges whose
  consumer and dependency belong to the selected epoch. Edges crossing epoch
  boundaries are enforced by barriers, not passed to the local scheduler.
-/

/-
  SchedulingStrategy is intentionally absent from VectorPlan. This type-level
  boundary encodes P-Strategy: changing -ss cannot alter ownership, epochs,
  edges, transports, loop ids, or stable names.

/-
  Since edges are `consumer -> dependency`, every dependency epoch must have a
  rank no greater than its consumer epoch. Equality permits an intra-epoch edge;
  a smaller rank represents an already completed semantic phase. Unique ranks
  in `VectorPlanCertificate` prevent two distinct epochs from masquerading as
  the same phase.

  This certificate is the finite gate between planning and FIR lowering:

  * ids and epoch membership are unique and cover all loops;
  * every edge endpoint exists;
  * each induced epoch graph admits a valid topological schedule;
  * transports have the expected signal type and chunk size;
  * all edges respect fixed epoch order;
  * every loop labelled vectorizable carries its `VecSafe` witness.

  The fields are propositions because this file specifies required evidence.
  The Rust port should implement an executable `verify_vector_plan` whose
  successful result constructs the corresponding evidence or mirrors it in
  differential/exhaustive tests.

/-! ## Region-aware lowering and fission obligations -/

/-
  The four lowering rules correspond directly to the mathematical rewrite
  rules R-INLINE, R-LOCAL, R-CROSS, and R-CONTROL. `LoweringWitness` records the
  selected case and the two semantic obligations common to every case: effects
  are emitted exactly once and storage does not alter value bits. A cross-loop
  rule additionally carries its producer and transport.

        ∧ FissionSafe rest scalarBefore vectorBefore

/-
  An event identifies a dynamic sample, loop, and statement. `FissionSafe`
  states that every true dependence ordered by scalar execution remains ordered
  after loop fission. The dependence list is an abstract semantic object; the
  compiler checks the finite sufficient facts below instead of enumerating all
  runtime events.

  The five static facts summarize the implementable legality test. Their
  implication to dynamic `FissionSafe` is deliberately not asserted globally:
  it must be proved for the concrete faust-rs plan, dependence extraction, and
  execution relations.
-/

def StaticImpliesDynamicFission
    (Plan : Type) (staticSafe dynamicSafe : Plan -> Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ plan, staticSafe plan -> dynamicSafe plan

  The faust-rs port must instantiate `Plan`, `staticSafe`, and `dynamicSafe`,
  then prove `StaticImpliesDynamicFission`. It is intentionally a proof
  obligation here, not an assumed theorem.
-/

/-! ## Delay and transition semantics -/

/-
  The remaining definitions are polymorphic in the actual value and state
  representations. This keeps the specification usable for the interpreter,
  Cranelift, Wasm, AssemblyScript, and future backends.

  History is ordered newest first: `history[0]` is the previous sample. Delay
  zero reads the current value directly; delay `n > 0` reads slot `n - 1`.
  Out-of-range reads return `none`, forcing the concrete compiler proof to show
  that declared maximum delay bounds are respected.
-/

  if delay = 0 then some current else history[delay - 1]?

def historyStep (current : Value) (history : List Value) : List Value :=
  (current :: history).take history.length

/-
  `historyStep` inserts the current value and drops the oldest slot. The length
  theorem proves that one transition preserves the abstract delay-state shape.

  structural recursion gives Lean an immediate termination proof and exposes
  zero/successor equations for later simulations.

structure ExecutionResult (State Output Observation : Type) where
  finalState : State
  outputs : List Output
  observations : List Observation

/-
  Equality of execution results covers persistent state, all output samples,
  and externally visible observations. Instantiations should include tables and
  UI zones in `State` or `Observation`, so simulation cannot ignore them.
-/

inductive LoopVariant where

  ∀ vecSize variant epochSchedules initialState inputs,
    0 < vecSize ->
    scheduleValid epochSchedules ->
    vectorRun vecSize variant epochSchedules initialState inputs =
      scalarRun initialState inputs

/-
  `VSimulation` quantifies over both loop variants (`-lv 0` and `-lv 1`), every
  positive chunk size, every initial state, and input sequence.

  The `scheduleValid` premise is essential and was missing from an earlier draft:
  without it the statement demanded scalar/vector agreement even for a
  non-topological (invalid) per-epoch schedule, which is false. `scheduleValid`
  is the program-indexed refinement (each element valid for its epoch graph,
  via `ValidScheduleRel`) supplied by the faust-rs execution model; here it is an
  abstract parameter so the definition states the theorem that is actually true.
-/

def ScheduleIndependent
    (Schedule Observation : Type)
    (valid : Schedule -> Prop)
    (execute : Schedule -> Observation) : Prop :=
  ∀ left right, valid left -> valid right -> execute left = execute right

/-
  Schedule independence is the semantic requirement behind exposing `-ss`:
  any two valid orders must produce the same observation. Topological validity
  alone is insufficient; the vector-plan certificate's transport, effect, and
  barrier obligations are the premises needed by the eventual proof.
