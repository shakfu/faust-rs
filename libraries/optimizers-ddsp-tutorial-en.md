# Learning DSP parameters inside Faust: a beginner's tutorial

French version: [optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-fr.md](optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-fr.md)
(same content; keep both versions synchronized). Background and design
rationale: [optimizers-overview-en.md](optimizers-overview-en.md).

This tutorial assumes you can read and write ordinary Faust and nothing else.
It starts from a gradient written by hand and ends on programs that learn
inside the Faust graph: a gain, a filter pole, a resonant filter's frequency
and Q, the five coefficients of a biquad kept stable through reflection
coefficients, sixteen FIR taps from one reverse sweep, an echo canceller and
a small neural network.

Along the way the loss becomes yours to write, the update gets a schedule, a
gate, a readout and a reset, Newton solves what does not need learning, `rad`
hands its gradients to a host instead of stepping inside the graph, and
`ondemand` runs an optimizer at its own rate — a spectral loss once per frame
while the gradient stays at audio rate; an existing program, finally, learns
its own sliders without being rewritten. The last chapter is for when the start
is wrong: reading the landscape before choosing an optimizer, starting from an
estimate, several starts at once, restarting on no progress, a loss that
widens the basin, and descending with no gradient at all. By the end you will
know which tool to reach for when something does not converge. Every program
was run on the current compiler; the numbers you should see are given after
each one.

## 0. Setting up

Compile with the project-local library directory and the Faust standard
libraries on the import path, and in double precision — gradients of recursive filters lose accuracy fast in
single precision:

```sh
faust-rs -double -I libraries -I <faustlibraries> -lang cpp program.dsp
```

To *see* a program learn without wiring audio, `faustprobe` renders it offline
and prints selected frames and statistics. All examples below were checked
with it, and `crates/cranelift-ffi/tests/tutorial_examples.rs` keeps them
checked: it extracts every program of this page, runs it as the text says
and asserts the figures quoted after it. The part of the command that never
changes is the compiler's: double precision and the import path (replace
`<faustlibraries>` by the directory holding `stdfaust.lib`):

```sh
FP="faustprobe --double -I libraries -I <faustlibraries>"
```

Each example then gives the options of its own run, to put between `$FP`
and the program: `-n` is the number of frames rendered, `--every N` prints
one frame out of N, `--skip` starts the printed frames and the statistics
later, `--quiet` prints only the per-output statistics (peak, rms, dc), and
`--in sine:220` feeds a sine where the program has an input (most programs
here have none and take no `--in`). The first example reads:

```sh
$FP -n 1200 --every 200 program.dsp
```

Read
[docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md](../docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md) for the
rest.

The library is loaded with a prefix:

```faust
op = library("optimizers.lib");
```

## 1. The smallest learning loop, by hand

Start with a gain. Some hidden system multiplies a signal by `0.7`; we hear its
output (the **target**) and the input, and we want our own gain `g` to match.

Four ideas, in the order they appear in the code:

- **model**: what we compute, `g * x`;
- **loss**: how wrong we are at this sample, `(g * x - target)^2` — squared so
  that it is positive and smooth;
- **gradient**: how the loss changes when `g` changes. For this loss it is
  `2 (g x - target) x`: positive when `g` is too large, negative when too
  small;
- **update**: move `g` against the gradient, `g <- g - lr * gradient`, where
  the learning rate `lr` sets the step size.

Together these four are **gradient descent**: the loss is a bowl over `g`,
the gradient is the slope of the bowl at the current `g`, and each step
slides a little way down the slope; where the slope is zero, at the bottom,
`g * x = target`, the steps stop. Nothing is solved in closed form — the
answer `0.7` is never computed, only approached, one step per sample, the
learning rate deciding how far each step goes: too small and it crawls, too
large and it overshoots the bottom and diverges. The version here, where
each step uses the gradient of the current sample alone rather than of a
whole recording, is *stochastic* gradient descent, which the signal
processing literature has known since 1960 as the LMS algorithm; the
library packages it as `op.sgd_g` and offers other steppers on the same
gradient (section 3, section 5.3).

The update needs memory: the new `g` depends on the previous one. In Faust,
memory is recursion, and `~ _` feeds the previous output back as the input of
the next sample. Here is the loop written by hand, and next to it the same
loop where `fad` computes the derivative instead of us:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = 0.7 * x;
lr = 0.01;
loss(g) = (g * x - target) * (g * x - target);
// gradient written by hand: d/dg (g x - t)^2 = 2 (g x - t) x
g_manual = (\(g).(g - lr * 2.0 * (g * x - target) * x)) ~ _;
// the same gradient computed by fad
g_fad = (\(g).(g - lr * (fad(loss(g), g) : !, _))) ~ _;
process = g_manual, g_fad, g_manual - g_fad;
```

`fad(loss(g), g)` returns two signals, the loss and its derivative with
respect to `g`; `: !, _` drops the first and keeps the second. The seed `g` is
the lambda's argument, that is the previous value of the recursion.

Run it (`-n 1200 --every 200`). Both gains climb from 0 to `0.699` in about
1 000 samples (23 ms), and the third output — the difference between the
hand-written and the automatic derivative — is exactly `0` on every frame.
That is the whole promise of automatic differentiation: the derivative of your
program, exact, without writing it.

> **Why it converges.** The gradient points uphill on the loss; stepping
> against it goes downhill. With `lr = 0.01` and a noise of unit variance the
> effective time constant is about `1 / (lr * E[x^2])` ≈ 300 samples.

## 2. Reading `fad` and `rad`

Before using the library, look at what the primitives return. Two sliders,
one product:

```faust
x = hslider("x", 2.0, 0.0, 10.0, 0.01);
y = hslider("y", 3.0, 0.0, 10.0, 0.01);
process = fad(x * y, (x, y)), rad(x * y, (x, y));
```

Run with `-n 1`: the six outputs are `6, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2`.

- `fad(expr, (s0, s1))` gives each output of `expr` followed by its
  derivatives with respect to each seed: `[x*y, d/dx = y, d/dy = x]`.
- `rad(expr, (s0, s1))` gives all outputs of `expr`, then the gradients:
  the same numbers here, in a different layout.

How the compiler gets there, on this product. Both primitives work on the
signal graph after the program has been expanded, where `x * y` is one
multiplication node with two leaves, the two sliders. A seed is recognised
by identity: the leaf `x` *is* seed 0, the leaf `y` *is* seed 1.

`fad` walks the graph from the leaves up and attaches to every node its
value and one tangent per seed. The leaf `x` carries `(x, [1, 0])`: its
derivative with respect to itself is 1, with respect to `y` 0; the leaf `y`
carries `(y, [0, 1])`. At the multiplication the product rule combines the
two bundles lane by lane, `d(uv) = du·v + u·dv`:

```text
lane 0 (d/dx):  1·y + x·0  =  y
lane 1 (d/dy):  0·y + x·1  =  x
```

so the node carries `(x·y, [y, x])`, which is the three outputs of `fad`.
The `·0` and `·1` do not survive: the simplifier folds them, and the
generated code computes `x * y`, then copies `y` and `x` to the tangent
outputs — nothing is differentiated at run time, the derivative is a
program.

`rad` walks the graph the other way. The output receives the adjoint 1
(the derivative of the output with respect to itself); the multiplication
passes to each factor the adjoint times the *other* factor, `1·y` to `x`
and `1·x` to `y`; a seed accumulates what reaches it. The gradient is
`[y, x]` again, from one pass over the graph whatever the number of seeds,
where `fad` carried one lane per seed through every node. On a product the
two costs are the same; on a loss with many parameters and a deep graph,
section 4.1 shows what changes.

With `x = 2` and `y = 3`: `6, 3, 2`, twice.

The seeds are whatever signals you list; for a loss with `N` parameters, one
call gives the `N` derivatives.

One rule to keep in mind: **a signal you list as a seed becomes an unknown
of its own, and the compiler forgets how it was computed.**
`fad(x + y, (x + y, x, y))` is read as a body `u` with three unknowns `u`,
`x`, `y`, and gives `1, 0, 0`: `u` depends on `u`, not on `x` or `y`. That
forgetting is what makes the learning loops of this tutorial work: in
`fad(loss, prev)`, `prev` is the parameter's current value, computed by the
recursion from the previous steps, and the derivative must not run back
through that history. So ask one question at a time. To differentiate with
respect to `x` and `y`, seed `(x, y)`, which gives `1, 1`. To differentiate
with respect to the quantity `x + y`, seed it alone. Listing both mixes the
two questions.

Most of this tutorial uses `fad`; `rad` comes
back in section 4.1 (many parameters), in section 10 (in real time inside
the graph, then handed to a host) and in section 11.4 (clocked).

## 3. The same loop with the library

The library packages the loop of section 1 as `descend_1D`: you give it the
loss as a function of the parameter, an **engine** that turns a gradient into
a step, bounds, an initial value and a reset signal, and it returns the
learned parameter:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = 0.7 * x;
loss(g) = op.mse(g * x, target);
g = op.descend_1D(loss, op.adam_g(0.002, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8), -4.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0);
process = g, target - g * x;
```

Run with `-n 3000 --every 500`: `g` reads `0.546, 0.685, 0.6998, 0.699999,
0.700000` at 500, 1 000, 1 500, 2 000, 2 500 samples, and the second output,
the residual, goes to zero with it.

Three things changed compared to section 1:

- `op.mse(y, t)` is the squared error; the library has other losses (section
  7);
- `op.adam_g(lr, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8)` is **Adam**, the default engine of deep
  learning. Instead of stepping by `lr * gradient`, it keeps a running average
  of the gradient (momentum) and of its square, and steps by
  `lr * average / sqrt(average of squares)`: the step size is about `lr`
  whatever the gradient's scale. Where plain descent needs `lr` tuned to the
  units of the problem, Adam needs `lr` tuned to how fast you want to move —
  here 0.002 per sample;
- the last four arguments are the bounds `[-4, 4]`, the initial value `0`,
  and a reset signal (`0` here; a `button("reset")` works).

Engines are partially applied: `op.adam_g(0.002, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8)` is a
function of one remaining argument, the gradient, which is what the loop calls
it with. The other gradient engines have the same shape:
`op.sgd_g(lr)`, `op.momentum_g(lr, 0.9)`, `op.rmsprop_g(lr, 0.999, 1e-8)`,
`op.lion_g(lr, 0.9, 0.99)`.

## 4. A filter: least squares and normalization

Now a parameter inside a recursion: the pole of a one-pole filter
`y[n] = x[n] + p y[n-1]`. Two things are new. The model has memory, so the
derivative of its output with respect to `p` depends on the whole past —
`fad` handles that by carrying the derivative along with the state, you do
not have to think about it. And we switch to the library's second family of
loops, `lsq_1D`, which differentiates the **model** rather than the loss:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
onepole(p, sig) = sig : + ~ *(p);
x = no.noise;
target = onepole(0.6, x);
p = op.lsq_1D(onepole, op.nlms(0.01, 1e-6, 0.99), -0.99, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, target, x);
process = p, target - onepole(p, x);
```

`lsq_1D(mdl, engine, lo, hi, init, reset, target, x)` takes the model as a
function `mdl(p, x)` and the target and input as signals; the loss is the
squared error. Its engines receive two numbers instead of one: the residual
`r = model - target` and the **sensitivity** `j = d(model)/dp`. Keeping them
apart allows **NLMS**, normalized LMS: the step `mu * r * j` is divided by the
smoothed power of `j`, so it does not depend on how loud the input is.

Run with `-n 4000 --every 500`: `p` is `0.600013` at 500 samples and
`0.600000` from 2 000 on.

Why normalization matters: with a plain `op.lms(0.02)` step tuned for an input
of level 1, the same 3-tap FIR converges perfectly at level 1, is a hundred
times too slow at level 0.1 and hits its bounds at level 10; with
`op.nlms(0.02, 1e-6, 0.99)` it converges identically at all three levels.
Audio levels vary by 40 dB in a session; normalize.

### 4.1 Many taps: bus loops and reverse mode

Section 4 learned one coefficient with `lsq_1D`. The library has the same
loop for two to five parameters, `lsq_2D` to `lsq_5D` (and `descend_2D` to
`descend_5D`, loss first), each parameter given as its own argument with
its own engine and bounds — section 5 uses `descend_2D` that way, section
6 `descend_5D`. That form stops at five. For sixteen FIR taps the library carries the
parameters as a *bus* and applies one engine and one pair of bounds to all
of them: `lsq_N_fad(N, mdl, engine, lo, hi, init, reset, target, x)`, and its
loss-first counterpart `descend_N_fad`, which this example uses in its `rad`
variant. The model becomes a block whose first `N` inputs are the taps:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
N = 16;
x = no.noise;
taps = x <: par(i, N, @(i));
fir(h) = (h, taps) : ro.interleave(N, 2) : par(i, N, *) :> _;
h_star(i) = sin(0.5 * i) * exp(-0.2 * i);
target = fir(par(i, N, h_star(i)));
fir_loss = fir(si.bus(N)) : sq_err with { sq_err(y) = op.mse(y, target); };
h = op.descend_N_rad(N, fir_loss, op.sgd_g(0.02), -2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0);
process = target - fir(h);
```

`descend_N_rad` is `descend_N_fad` with `rad` in place of `fad`: one reverse
sweep per sample gives the sixteen gradients where forward mode carries
sixteen tangents. Run with `-n 1000 --quiet`, then `-n 2000 --skip 1000
--quiet`, then `-n 3000 --skip 2000 --quiet`: the residual reads rms `0.10`,
`2e-7`, then `0`. Run both loops (`op.descend_N_fad` is the other): the residuals
are the same signal to rounding, and the compiled programs are not — 1 182
interpreter instructions against 3 777, 0.04 s against 0.10 s for 200 000
samples; 4 129 against 28 891 and 0.13 s against 1.32 s at 64 taps. The
sensitivity of a FIR tap is its delayed input, so both loops compute the
same gradient. Where they differ is a model with a recursion between the
parameters and the output: a gradient consumed inside a loop cannot wait
for the end of the block, so `rad` sees one sample and returns the *direct
term*, the past state held fixed (`2 r y[n-1]` for the one-pole above),
where `fad` carries the derivative through the recursion. The direct term
is the pseudo-linear-regression gradient of adaptive IIR filtering, cheaper
and convergent under a positivity condition on the model; `fad`'s is the
recursive-prediction-error gradient, the exact descent direction (section
4.7 of the overview). The rule of thumb: many parameters and a feed-forward
model, `_rad`; a recursion to learn, `fad`.

Two details of the program. `fir(si.bus(N))` is the model applied to sixteen
open inputs, the block a bus loop expects. And the loss names its input
(`sq_err(y)`) instead of writing `op.mse(_, target)`: a free `_` is
duplicated wherever the argument is used, so `(_ - t) * (_ - t)` would be a
two-input block and `:>` would split the taps between them — the loop then
learns nothing, and nothing warns.

## 5. Two parameters with different units

Identify a resonant low-pass: target `fi.resonlp(1200, 2.0)`, model
`fi.resonlp(f, q)`, started at `(1000, 1.0)`. The frequency is in hertz, the
quality factor has no unit. This is the moment beginners lose a day, so watch
what happens with a single learning rate.

### 5.1 One rate for both: the scale problem

Lion is an engine that steps by exactly `±lr` in the direction of its momentum
sign, whatever the gradient's magnitude — a good default when parameters have
different units, as long as `lr` makes sense for each of them:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = x : fi.resonlp(1200.0, 2.0, 1.0);
loss(f, q) = op.mse(x : fi.resonlp(f, q, 1.0), target);
lion = op.lion_g(0.001, 0.9, 0.99);
learned = op.descend_2D(loss, lion, lion, 20.0, 20000.0, 0.1, 10.0, 1000.0, 1.0, 0.0);
process = learned;
```

Run with `-n 100000 --every 10000`: `q` reaches 2.0, but `f` moves by 0.001 Hz
per sample — 1 Hz every 1 000 samples — and is still at 1 090 Hz after 100 000
samples. A step that is right for `q` is absurdly small for `f`. Two fixes
follow; both are worth knowing.

### 5.2 Fix one: learn in a domain where steps make sense

Learn `u = log(f)` instead of `f`. A step of 0.001 in `u` is a 0.1 % change of
frequency, which is the same kind of quantity as a step of 0.001 in `q`. The
model just applies `exp`:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = x : fi.resonlp(1200.0, 2.0, 1.0);
loss(u, q) = op.mse(x : fi.resonlp(exp(u), q, 1.0), target);
lion = op.lion_g(op.lr_exp(0.001, 0.00001, 20000.0), 0.9, 0.99);
learned = op.descend_2D(loss, lion, lion, log(20.0), log(20000.0), 0.1, 10.0, log(1000.0), 1.0, 0.0);
u = learned : _, !;
q = learned : !, _;
process = exp(u), q;
```

`op.lr_exp(0.001, 0.00001, 20000)` is a learning-rate **schedule**: it decays
exponentially from 0.001 towards 0.00001 with a time constant of 20 000
samples, so the search is fast at first and quiet at the end. Learning rates
are signals; a schedule is passed where a constant would be.

Run with `-n 30000 --every 10000`: `(1206, 2.003)` at 10 000 samples, then
within 5 % of `(1200, 2.0)` (`(1233, 2.03)` at 20 000). Good, with a residual
jitter that Lion's fixed step size leaves.

### 5.3 Fix two: let the algorithm find the scales

`lm_2D` is a damped **Gauss-Newton** loop, the recursive form of the method
system identification has used for decades. It builds a 2x2 matrix from the
sensitivities of both parameters, which encodes how strongly each affects the
output and how they interact, and solves for the step. No per-parameter rate:
one gain `mu`, one damping `lambda`, one forgetting factor `a`:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = x : fi.resonlp(1200.0, 2.0, 1.0);
mdl(f, q, sig) = sig : fi.resonlp(f, q, 1.0);
process = op.lm_2D(mdl, 0.01, 0.1, 0.99, 20.0, 20000.0, 0.1, 10.0, 1000.0, 1.0, 0.0, target, x);
```

Run with `-n 30000 --every 5000`: `(1200.000000, 2.000000)` at 5 000 samples
and it stays there. Rule of thumb for its settings: `mu = 1 - a`,
`lambda = 0.1`, `a` between 0.99 and 0.999. `lm_3D` does the same for three
parameters.

## 6. Stability: the five-coefficient biquad

A biquad has three zeros coefficients `b0, b1, b2` and two pole coefficients
`a1, a2`. The poles are dangerous: outside the region `|a2| < 1`,
`|a1| < 1 + a2` the filter is unstable, and once it has blown up no optimizer
recovers. Bounding `a1` and `a2` to a rectangle is not enough, because the
stable region is a triangle. Try it: learn `(a1, a2)` directly with rectangular
bounds, starting from `(1.9, -0.5)` — inside the rectangle, outside the
triangle — and, side by side, learn two **reflection coefficients**
`k1, k2 in (-1, 1)` that the library maps to `a1 = k1 (1 + k2)`, `a2 = k2`.
That map covers exactly the triangle, so every point of the `(k1, k2)` box is a
stable filter:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.pink_noise;
target = fi.tf2(0.1, 0.2, 0.1, -1.0, 0.4, x);
adam = op.adam_g(0.001, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8);
// (a) a1, a2 learned directly, rectangular bounds, started inside the bounds but outside the stability triangle
loss_raw(b0, b1, b2, a1, a2) = op.mse(fi.tf2(b0, b1, b2, a1, a2, x), target);
raw = op.descend_5D(loss_raw, adam, adam, adam, adam, adam,
                    -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -1.92, 1.92, -0.92, 0.92,
                    0, 0, 0, 1.9, -0.5, 0);
// (b) reflection coefficients: every point of the box is a stable filter
loss_k(b0, b1, b2, k1, k2) = op.mse(fi.tf2(b0, b1, b2, a1, a2, x), target)
with { a1 = op.poles_from_reflection(k1, k2) : _, !; a2 = op.poles_from_reflection(k1, k2) : !, _; };
kk = op.descend_5D(loss_k, adam, adam, adam, adam, adam,
                   -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -0.999, 0.999, -0.999, 0.999,
                   0, 0, 0, 0.95, -0.5, 0);
r4 = raw : !, !, !, _, !;
k1 = kk : !, !, !, _, !;
k2 = kk : !, !, !, !, _;
process = r4, op.poles_from_reflection(k1, k2);
```

Run with `-n 200000 --every 20000`: the raw `a1` (first output) is pinned at
its bound `1.92` from the first frames — the filter has blown up and the
gradient is garbage — while the reflection form (second and third outputs)
reaches `(-0.999, 0.3999)` for a target of `(-1.0, 0.4)` after 60 000
samples.

Note the two Faust idioms in `loss_k`: there is no destructuring, so the two
outputs of `poles_from_reflection` are projected with `: _, !` and `: !, _`;
and a five-output expression applied to a five-argument function is a partial
application, not a spread, so the coefficients are projected one by one.

The complete example, with a target the user controls, a reset button and a
single Lion rate on an exponential schedule, is section 4 of
[docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md](../docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md): the five
coefficients land within `1e-5` of the target after 300 000 samples.

## 7. The loss is yours

With `descend_ND` the loss is any Faust function of the parameters. Two
situations where the squared error is the wrong loss:

### 7.1 Outliers

Add impulsive spikes of `±20` every 97 samples to a target of amplitude 0.7,
and learn the gain through `mse` and through `logcosh`, a loss that is
quadratic near zero and linear far away, so its gradient is bounded:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
spike = float((ba.time % 97) == 0) * 20.0 * op.sgn(x');
target = 0.7 * x + spike;
g_mse = op.descend_1D(\(g).(op.mse(g * x, target)), op.sgd_g(0.01), -4, 4, 0, 0);
g_robust = op.descend_1D(\(g).(op.logcosh(g * x, target)), op.sgd_g(0.01), -4, 4, 0, 0);
process = g_mse, g_robust;
```

Run with `-n 40000 --every 5000`: the `mse` gain wanders between 0.49 and
0.88, kicked by every spike; the `logcosh` gain stays within 0.69–0.71.
`op.pseudo_huber(delta, y, t)` is the other robust loss, with an explicit
transition scale.

### 7.2 Matching a sound, not a waveform

Sample-by-sample error assumes the model and the target see the *same*
excitation. Often they do not: you want the model to sound like the target,
not to reproduce its waveform. Comparing smoothed powers ignores phase.
Here the target is a low-pass at 800 Hz on one noise, the model a low-pass on
an independent noise, the loss compares the log powers, and the cutoff is
learned in the log domain with plain SGD:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
excitation_a = no.noise;
excitation_b = no.noises(4, 1);   // an independent noise generator
target = excitation_a : fi.lowpass(1, 800.0);
loss(u) = op.log_energy_loss(0.999, 1e-9, excitation_b : fi.lowpass(1, exp(u)), target);
u = op.descend_1D(loss, op.sgd_g(0.00005), log(20.0), log(10000.0), log(3000.0), 0.0);
process = exp(u), exp(op.polyak(0.9999, u));
```

Run with `-n 400000 --every 50000`: the cutoff comes down from 3 000 Hz and
settles between 770 and 850 Hz — a jitter that comes from estimating a power
over about 1 000 samples of noise. `op.polyak(0.9999, u)` is a smoothed
readout of the parameter for the audible path. With `mse` on this pair of
signals the cutoff would stay stuck at the 20 Hz bound: there is nothing to
learn from a waveform that cannot be matched.

Two rules that this example teaches:

- a loss built on a smoothing (`energy_loss`, `log_energy_loss`) sees the
  world with a delay of about `1 / (1 - a)` samples; the optimizer must be
  slower than that or the loop oscillates — hence `lr = 5e-5` here;
- on a noisy loss, prefer SGD to Adam: SGD's step follows the gradient
  magnitude and dies out near the optimum, Adam's step is always about `lr`,
  which becomes a random walk.

## 8. Hygiene: schedules, gating, readout, reset

Real signals stop and start. An optimizer that keeps learning in silence
drifts on noise; one that never slows down jitters forever. This example puts
the tools together: the signal is present half of the time, a small
measurement noise is added, learning is gated on the input power, the learning
rate decays, the readout is averaged, and a button resets the parameter:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
present = float((ba.time % 20000) < 10000);        // signal present half of the time
x = no.noise * present;
target = 0.7 * x + 0.001 * no.noises(4, 2);       // plus measurement noise
loss(g) = op.mse(g * x, target);
vad = op.ema(0.99, x * x) > 0.001;                 // learn only when there is signal
lr = op.lr_exp(0.02, 0.001, 20000.0);
upd(grad) = op.sgd_g(lr, op.gate_g(vad, grad));
g = op.descend_1D(loss, upd, -4, 4, 0, button("reset"));
process = g, op.polyak(0.999, g), lr;
```

Run with `-n 80000 --every 10000`: `g` is at `0.69994` after 10 000 samples
and within `±6e-5` of 0.7 afterwards; the third output shows the learning rate
going from 0.02 to 0.0016. `upd` shows how conditioning composes: it is an
ordinary function of the gradient, built from library pieces, passed as the
engine.

`gate_g` zeroes the gradient but still computes it, and so does the model
that carries the tangents. To stop paying for the learning once the
parameters have settled, put the whole loop in an `ondemand` whose clock a
convergence criterion switches off: section 7, "Two phases: learning, then
use", of [optimizers-overview-en.md](optimizers-overview-en.md) shows the
pattern and measures it on a reverb: once the learning has stopped the
program runs eight to twenty-five times faster than while learning (23
times real time learning, 196 after the switch, 572 with the coefficients
hoisted).

## 9. Solving instead of learning: Newton

The same derivative machinery solves equations. Virtual-analog models are full
of implicit ones — the output of a saturating feedback loop depends on itself:
`y = tanh(x - fb * y)`. [Newton's
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) finds `y` in a few
steps, `y <- y - F(y) / F'(y)`, each needing the residual
`F(y) = y - tanh(x - fb y)` and its derivative `F'(y)`; one `fad` gives both,
and `op.newton(N, F, y0)` unrolls `N` steps:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
fb = 2.0;
// implicit saturator: y = tanh(x - fb * y), solved for y every sample
residual(x, y) = y - ma.tanh(x - fb * y);
solve(x) = op.newton(5, residual(x), 0.0);
process(x) = solve(x), residual(x, solve(x));
```

Run with `--in sine:220 -n 2000 --skip 1000 --quiet`: the first output is the
solved signal (peak 0.33 for a unit sine, the feedback compresses it), the
second is the residual of the solution — `0` to numerical precision on every
frame. This is the building block of zero-delay-feedback filters and diode
clippers.

## 10. Reverse mode in real time, then handed to a host: `rad`

Section 2 introduced `rad` as the other layout of the same numbers, and
section 4.1 used it through `descend_N_rad`. This section writes it by hand
inside the graph, as section 1 did for `fad`, then puts it in two programs
that learn in real time, and ends with the use where it only produces
gradients for a host. The rule of section 4.1 holds throughout: a `rad`
consumed inside the graph sees one sample, which is exact for a model with no
recursion between the parameters and the output, and gives only the direct
term otherwise.

### 10.1 Three taps, one sweep

A three-tap FIR learned by hand, like the gain of section 1, but with one
`rad` for the three gradients instead of three `fad`s:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = 0.5 * x + 0.3 * x' - 0.2 * x'';
lr = 0.02;
model(h0, h1, h2) = h0 * x + h1 * x' + h2 * x'';
loss(h0, h1, h2) = (model(h0, h1, h2) - target) * (model(h0, h1, h2) - target);
step(h0, h1, h2) = h0 - lr * g0, h1 - lr * g1, h2 - lr * g2
with {
    grads = rad(loss(h0, h1, h2), (h0, h1, h2)) : !, _, _, _;   // one sweep, three gradients
    g0 = grads : _, !, !;
    g1 = grads : !, _, !;
    g2 = grads : !, !, _;
};
taps = step ~ (_, _, _);
process = taps, target - (taps : model);
```

Run with `-n 3000 --every 500`: the taps read `0.4995, 0.2997, -0.1999` at
500 samples, `0.5, 0.3, -0.2` to `1e-6` at 1 000, exactly afterwards, and
the residual is zero. `rad(loss, (h0, h1, h2))` returns four signals, the
loss then the three gradients; `: !, _, _, _` drops the loss. The three
projections of `grads` cost one sweep: the compiler shares the expression.
Compare with section 1: the `fad` of a loss with `N` parameters reads
`fad(loss, (h0, h1, h2))` too, with the same output here; the difference is
in the generated code, one reverse sweep against three carried tangents, and
it grows with `N`.

### 10.2 An adaptive effect: the echo canceller

The far-end signal of a conference goes to a loudspeaker; the microphone
picks up its echo through the room. The canceller learns an FIR replica of
the room response and subtracts it from the microphone signal, the NLMS echo
canceller of every conferencing system. Here the room is a synthetic 64-tap
response, and the loop is `lsq_N_rad`, the reverse-mode version of the bus
loop of section 4.1 with the `nlms` engine:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
N = 64;
far = no.noise;
room(i) = sin(1.7 * i + 0.3) * exp(-i / 12.0);
fir = si.bus(N), (_ <: par(i, N, @(i))) : ro.interleave(N, 2) : par(i, N, *) :> _;
mic = (par(i, N, room(i)), far) : fir;
h = op.lsq_N_rad(N, fir, op.nlms(0.01, 0.000001, 0.99), -2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, mic, far);
residual = mic - ((h, far) : fir);
process = residual, mic;
```

Run with `-n 4000 --quiet`, then in windows of 1 000 samples
(`--skip 1000 -n 2000`, and so on): the residual starts at the level of the
echo, rms `2.6` over the first window with a transient peak of 25 while the
taps overshoot, falls to `1.4e-4` over the second, `2e-8` over the third and
`0` afterwards, an echo return loss enhancement beyond 100 dB on this
noiseless room. The sensitivity of the FIR output to tap `i` is the delayed
far-end sample `x[n - i]`: 64 sensitivities, one output, which reverse mode
gives in one sweep per sample where `lsq_N_fad` would carry 64 tangents. The FIR
has no recursion with respect to the taps, so the one-sample horizon loses
nothing. `mu = 0.01`: with 64 taps sharing the step, the stability bound of
NLMS (`mu < 2/N` in these units) sets it. To try: make `room` depend on a
slider and change it on the fly, the canceller reconverges; add a near-end
talker to the microphone and the taps drift, the double-talk problem, whose
classic answer is to gate the update with `gate_g`.

### 10.3 A small neural network in the loop

Reverse mode is the mode of neural networks: a scalar loss, many parameters,
the adjoint flowing back from the output to every unit. A network with one
hidden layer of four `tanh` units, thirteen parameters, learns inside the
graph to imitate a soft clipper, neural amp modelling at its smallest:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
H = 4;
x = no.noise;
target = 0.8 * ma.tanh(3.0 * x) + 0.1 * x;
w1_0(j) = 1.0 + 0.5 * j;
b1_0(j) = -0.6 + 0.4 * j;
unit(j, w, b) = ma.tanh((w + w1_0(j)) * x + b + b1_0(j));
// the network as a block of its 13 parameters: (w1 x 4, b1 x 4, w2 x 4, b2)
hidden = (si.bus(H), si.bus(H)) : ro.interleave(H, 2) : par(j, H, (_, _ : unit(j)));
net = (hidden, si.bus(H), _) : ((ro.interleave(H, 2) : par(j, H, *) :> _), _) : +;
net_loss = net : sq_err with { sq_err(y) = op.mse(y, target); };
p = op.descend_N_rad(3 * H + 1, net_loss, op.adam_g(0.003, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8), -4.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0);
process = target - (p : net), target;
```

Run with `-n 2000 --quiet` then `-n 20000 --skip 16000 --quiet`: the
residual falls from rms `0.105` over the first 2 000 samples (the initial
function of the offsets is 17 dB below the target) to `0.0037` over the last
4 000, 46 dB below the target. `descend_N_rad(13, net_loss, adam, …)`
differentiates `mse(net(p), target)` by one reverse sweep per sample for the
thirteen gradients; Adam is shared by the thirteen (one engine expression,
one state per parameter), because the units have different sensitivities and
it equalises them. One detail that is not differentiation: a bus loop starts
every parameter from the same value, which would leave the four units
identical for ever; the model adds fixed, distinct offsets `w1_0`, `b1_0` to
the learned weights, and the parameters are learned from zero around that
initialisation. Remove them and the units collapse onto each other. The
network has no state, so a target with memory, a one-pole after the clipper,
escapes it: give `x` and `x'` to the units, or add a learned one-pole after
`net`.

### 10.4 Handing gradients to a host

Sometimes the program should only *produce* derivatives, and a host (a
plugin, a Python script, a test harness) does the accumulation and the
update — for example to train on a batch of recordings rather than on the
live signal:

```faust
gain = hslider("gain", 1.0, -4.0, 4.0, 0.001);
bias = hslider("bias", 0.0, -4.0, 4.0, 0.001);
process = rad(gain * _ + bias, (gain, bias));
```

Run with `--in sine:220 -n 5`: three outputs, `[gain * x + bias, x, 1]` — the
output and its two gradients. The host reads them, forms the loss gradient
(`2 * (out - target) * d/dgain`, summed over a block), and writes the sliders
back. [docs/rad-usage-en.md](../docs/rad-usage-en.md) has the full loop in
Rust, including an adaptive notch filter. As a public output, `rad` works
block by block through delays and recursions: the sweep runs backwards over
the current `compute` block with the derivative reset at its end, and the
gradient lanes are per-sample contributions the host sums. That is the
difference with the three programs above: consumed inside the graph, `rad`
sees one sample; handed to the host, it goes through the recursion over the
whole block, and the sum of a lane is the exact gradient of the block's
loss, which example 6 of [ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md) checks
against finite differences on a resonator.

Since the loop is the host's, faustprobe can play the host. Give the
program a target and put the loss in front of the gradient lanes:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
gain = hslider("gain", 1.0, -4.0, 4.0, 0.001);
bias = hslider("bias", 0.0, -4.0, 4.0, 0.001);
x = no.noise;
target = 0.5 * x - 0.25;          // the values the host has to find
loss = op.mse(gain * x + bias, target);
process = rad(loss, (gain, bias));
```

Run with `--block 256 --train gain,bias --lr 0.05 --blocks 100 --every 20
--fd-check`: the first lines compare each gradient lane, summed over a
block, with a finite difference of the loss lane (relative error `2e-13`
here); then one CSV row per 20 blocks with the block's mean loss and the
two controls after the step, from `(0.363, -0.223)` at block 20 to
`(0.5013, -0.2511)` at block 100, the loss from `0.15` to `1.2e-6`; with
`--optimizer sgd --lr 0.5` the pair is exact at block 100. Per block,
faustprobe writes the controls, computes the block, averages the lanes,
steps by Adam or SGD and keeps the controls in their range — the loop a
host writes, described in section 13 of
[docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md](../docs/faustprobe-user-guide-en.md),
with `--in file:` and `--reset-per-block` for a recorded target replayed
from a cleared state at every block.

### 10.5 Through time: what the block sweep sees

Section 4.1 said that inside a loop `rad` returns the *direct term*, and
section 10.4 that, handed to the host, it goes through the recursion over
the block. One pole makes both visible. The target is `onepole(0.9, x)`,
the model the same filter with `r` as a slider; the second output is the
direct term written by hand, the gradient with `y[n-1]` held fixed:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
r = hslider("r", 0.3, -0.99, 0.99, 0.001);
x = no.noise;
onepole(c, s) = s : + ~ *(c);          // y[n] = s[n] + c * y[n-1]
target = onepole(0.9, x);
y = onepole(r, x);
loss = op.mse(y, target);
direct = 2.0 * (y - target) * y';      // the gradient with y[n-1] held fixed
process = rad(loss, r), direct;
```

Run with `--block 256 -n 256 --quiet`: `dc` times 256 is the sum of a lane
over the block, `-172.9` for the `rad` lane and `-117.2` for the direct
term. Then `--block 256 --train r --blocks 1 --fd-check`: the finite
difference of the block's loss is `-172.9`, within `1e-6` of the `rad`
lane. The lane is the exact gradient of the block's loss, which is only
possible if the sweep went back through `y[n-1]` at every sample: this is
backpropagation through time, the derivative of the block's output with
respect to `r` through every past state. The direct term misses a third of
it, the part that comes from `y[n-1]` depending on `r` itself.

The horizon is the block. At its end the sweep starts from a zero adjoint,
so what the states before the block owe to `r` is not counted: truncated
BPTT, the block being the truncation. The pole's time constant is
`1 / (1 - 0.9) = 10` samples and a block of 16 covers it: `--block 16
--train r --lr 0.01 --blocks 800 --every 200` reads `0.8964, 0.900005,
0.900001, 0.900000`. With `--block 1` the sweep sees one sample, the lane
*is* the direct term, and the same loop never settles: after 3 200 steps `r`
swings between 0.53 and its bound 0.99. Example 10 of
[ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md) is the same mechanism on a GRU
with 27 parameters.

## 11. Learning at its own rate: `ondemand`

Everything so far ran once per sample: the model, the derivative, and the
update. Nothing forces the update to be that frequent. `faust-rs` has a
primitive, `ondemand`, that runs a sub-expression only when a clock fires and
holds its outputs in between:

```faust
(clock, inputs...) : ondemand(body)
```

`ondemand(body)` has one more input than `body`, the clock, first. Inside the
body, time is *fire time*: a `~` recursion advances once per firing, a delay
is one firing long. That is exactly what an optimizer wants when it should
step once per frame. `interleave.lib` (also in `libraries/`) provides the
frame clock, `il.frame_clock(N)`, which fires every `N` samples, and
`il.serialize_in(N)`, which turns a stream into the `N` parallel samples of
the current frame.

### 11.1 The whole optimizer, clocked

Put the loop of section 3 inside a block that fires every 64 samples. The
body receives the excitation and the target as inputs and closes the loss
over them:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = 0.7 * x;
learn(xi, ti) = op.descend_1D(\(g).(op.mse(g * xi, ti)), op.adam_g(0.02, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8), -4.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0);
g = (il.frame_clock(64), x, target) : ondemand(learn);
process = g, target - g * x;
```

Run with `-n 20000 --every 2000`: `g` reads `0.630` at 4 000 samples, `0.7097`
at 6 000, `0.70005` at 12 000 and `0.7000 ± 1e-6` at the end — after 312
optimizer steps instead of 20 000. Between firings `g` is held, so the model
`g * x` at audio rate always sees a valid parameter. The `fad` graph, the
expensive part, runs 64 times less often; the price is that each step sees one
sample of the frame, hence `lr = 0.02` rather than `0.002`.

### 11.2 Gradient at audio rate, update per frame

A better use of the frame: compute the gradient on every sample, average it,
and let the block apply one step per frame. The block receives the previous
parameter and the averaged gradient as explicit inputs, and its held output is
fed back with `~`:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
N = 64;
x = no.noise;
target = 0.7 * x;
lr = 0.5;
g = learn ~ _
with {
    learn(gprev) = (il.frame_clock(N), gprev, gavg) : ondemand(step)
    with {
        grad = fad(op.mse(gprev * x, target), gprev) : !, _;   // audio rate
        gavg = op.ema(1.0 - 1.0 / N, grad);                     // averaged over ~N samples
        step(gp, ga) = op.clip(-4.0, 4.0, gp - lr * ga);        // once per frame
    };
};
process = g, target - g * x;
```

Run with `-n 20000 --every 2000`: `0.700000` from 4 000 samples on. Nothing is
lost by averaging: the frame-rate step sees the mean gradient of the frame,
which is what a batch step in a training framework sees. Note the shape: the
seed `gprev` and the `fad` are outside the block, the update is inside, and
the two communicate only through the block's inputs and its held output.

The library packages this pattern as `descend_1D_clocked` (and `2D` … `5D`):
same arguments as `descend_1D` with the clock first. It averages the gradient
with `op.frame_mean`, an exact mean over the frame reset by the clock, keeps
the parameter at `init` until the first firing, and latches a reset shorter
than a frame until the next firing:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
x = no.noise;
target = 0.7 * x;
loss(g) = op.mse(g * x, target);
g = op.descend_1D_clocked(il.frame_clock(64), loss, op.sgd_g(0.5), -4.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0);
process = g, target - g * x;
```

Run with `-n 20000 --every 2000`: `0.700000` from 4 000 samples on, like the
hand-written version. The engine runs in fire time, so an Adam or a schedule
given here counts frames, not samples: on the resonant filter of section 5,
`op.descend_2D_clocked(il.frame_clock(64), loss, adam, adam, ...)` with
`adam = op.adam_g(0.02, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8)` on `(log f, q)` reaches
`(1200.2, 1.996)` after 10 000 samples and stays within 1 % of `(1200, 2.0)`
afterwards — Adam's fixed step leaves the usual small wobble, which a
schedule removes.

### 11.3 A spectral loss, one step per frame

This is the pattern that brings Faust closest to how DDSP papers train: a loss
on a *spectrum*, updated once per frame. The frame of `N = 8` samples enters
the block as eight inputs; inside, the loss scales the frame by `g`, takes an
FFT (`an.fft` from `analyzers.lib`), sums the magnitudes and compares the sum
with a target; `descend_1D` runs on that loss, in fire time:

```faust
il = library("interleave.lib");
an = library("analyzers.lib");
si = library("signals.lib");
no = library("noises.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
N = 8;
target_energy = 4.0;
cmag(re, im) = sqrt(re * re + im * im + 0.000000001);
magsum = par(m, N, cmag) :> _;
// The block receives the N samples of the frame as named arguments (a frame
// operator with free `_` inputs would get its inputs duplicated at each use).
learn(x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7) =
    op.descend_1D(loss, op.adam_g(0.02, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8), 0.01, 10.0, 1.0, 0.0)
with {
    // spectral loss of the frame scaled by g: (sum |X_k| - target)^2
    loss(g) = (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7) : par(i, N, *(g) : (_, 0)) : an.fft(N) : magsum : -(target_energy) <: _ * _;
};
process = no.noise : il.serialize_in(N) : (il.frame_clock(N), si.bus(N)) : ondemand(learn);
```

Run with `-n 40000 --skip 20000 --quiet`: `g` averages `0.3405` over the second
half, with a frame-to-frame jitter of about `±0.03` — the spectrum of a random
frame varies, so the loss is noisy. The least-squares optimum for this noise
can be computed by hand: `0.340`. A magnitude with an epsilon under the square
root keeps the derivative defined at an empty bin.

The comment in the code is a rule to remember: a frame operator written with
free `_` inputs must not be passed around as an open expression, because every
use duplicates its inputs — the block's arity explodes into a "sequential
composition mismatch". Give the body named arguments.

A variant keeps the parameter outside the block and passes it in as an
explicit input; the block then outputs the held gradient, and the update
`g - lr * grad * clock` is gated by the clock at audio rate. It reaches the
same `0.34`. What does *not* work is reading an outer audio-rate signal
inside the body by its name: a definition referenced in a body is
instantiated again in the body's own time (`ba.time` inside a block counts
firings, an outer oscillator becomes a fresh one stepping once per firing),
so the outer signal is only seen through an input. Keep the seed, the loss
and the update in the same domain, or connect them through the block's
inputs.

Three last things about clock domains. `ma.SR` is not adapted inside
`ondemand` (its rate is unknown statically), so compute rate-dependent values
outside and pass them in. `rad` does not cross a domain boundary; its
clocked forms are the subject of section 11.4. And the reference for the
primitives themselves, including `upsampling` and `downsampling`, is
[docs/ondemand-note-en.md](../docs/ondemand-note-en.md).

### 11.4 Reverse mode, clocked

The bus loops of section 10 have their clocked form, `descend_N_rad_clocked`:
the reverse sweep runs at audio rate within the frame, its `N` gradients are
averaged by `frame_mean`, and the step is taken inside an `ondemand` block,
once per frame. The sixteen-tap FIR of section 4.1, one step every 64
samples:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
N = 16;
x = no.noise;
taps = x <: par(i, N, @(i));
fir(h) = (h, taps) : ro.interleave(N, 2) : par(i, N, *) :> _;
h_star(i) = sin(0.5 * i) * exp(-0.2 * i);
target = fir(par(i, N, h_star(i)));
fir_loss = fir(si.bus(N)) : sq_err with { sq_err(y) = op.mse(y, target); };
h = op.descend_N_rad_clocked(N, il.frame_clock(64), fir_loss, op.sgd_g(0.5), -2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0);
process = target - fir(h);
```

Run in windows of 1 000 samples (`-n 1000 --quiet`, then `-n 2000 --skip
1000 --quiet`, and so on) and, next to it, the per-sample version of section
4.1 (`descend_N_rad`, `lr = 0.02`): the
residual of the clocked loop reads rms `0.21`, `6e-4`, `1.6e-6`, `3e-9` over
the first four windows, that of the per-sample loop `0.10`, `2e-7`, then `0`.
The clocked loop takes 64 times fewer steps with a rate 25 times larger, and
each step sees the frame's mean gradient: after 1 000 samples it has taken 15
steps and the residual is at `6e-4`, where the per-sample loop has taken
1 000 and is at `2e-7`. It converges a little more slowly, for an engine that
runs once per frame, which matters when the engine is an Adam with `N`
states or when the update must be rare by construction. The price is that of
section 11.1: the time constant counts frames.

A `rad` can also live entirely *inside* a block, loss and seeds included,
and then runs at frame rate on a frame loss, like the spectral loss of
section 11.3; that is what example 11 of
[ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md) does, sixteen harmonic amplitudes
fitted through a spectral loss per 256-sample frame, the sixteen gradients
from one sweep per frame. What stays forbidden is a `rad` that would cross
the block's boundary, a loss inside and a seed outside.

### 11.5 Reading and measuring the sliders of a program

So far every parameter was a function argument, written so that `fad` could
take it as a seed. A real program has sliders instead. Its parameters are
`hslider`s in their own units, and nobody wants to rewrite it as a function
of its knobs. Two primitives read them, without rewriting the program:

- `cinputs(e)` lists the control inputs of `e` in the order of its
  interface;
- `cinput(i, e)` gives the `i`-th as `(widget, default, min, max, step)`.

Take a program of two lines, written as one writes an effect:

```faust
e = fi.lowpass(1, hslider("cutoff", 1000, 50, 5000, 1)) : *(hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01));
```

First, what it exposes:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
e = fi.lowpass(1, hslider("cutoff", 1000, 50, 5000, 1)) : *(hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01));
N = outputs(cinputs(e));
process = N, par(i, N, cinput(i, e) : !, si.bus(4));
```

Run with `-n 1`: `2, 1000, 50, 5000, 1, 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01`. These are the
number of controls, then the default, minimum, maximum and step of `cutoff`
and of `gain`, in interface order. They are compile-time constants.

Before learning a program's sliders, it pays to ask which of them the output
actually depends on at the current setting. `controls.lib` answers with two
lines. `ct.gradient_fad(e)` is `fad(e, cinputs(e))`: the outputs of `e`, then
the derivative of each output with respect to every slider, in `cinputs`
order. `ct.gradient_rad(e)` is `rad(e, cinputs(e))`: the same question by one
reverse sweep, whatever the number of sliders, for the sum of the outputs.

The program under study is an effect with seven sliders: a tight high-pass,
a drive into `tanh`, a tone low-pass, a tremolo (`depth`, `rate`), and two
output gains in series, `level` and `trim`. Each derivative is multiplied by
its slider's range (`ct.range`), so every column reads the same way: how much
the output would move, to first order, if that slider crossed its whole
range.

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
ct = library("controls.lib");
e = fi.highpass(1, hslider("tight", 80, 20, 400, 1))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("drive", 12, 0, 30, 0.1))) : ma.tanh
  : fi.lowpass(1, hslider("tone", 3000, 500, 8000, 1))
  : *(1 - hslider("depth", 0, 0, 1, 0.01) * (0.5 + 0.5 * sin(2 * ma.PI * os.phasor(1, hslider("rate", 4, 0.5, 10, 0.01)))))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("level", -6, -40, 0, 0.1)))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("trim", 0, -12, 12, 0.1)));
x = 0.3 * (0.7 * os.sawtooth(110) + 0.3 * no.noise);
process = x : ct.gradient_fad(e) : _, par(i, ct.count(e), *(ct.range(i, e)));
```

Run with `-n 44100 --quiet` and read the `rms` of each column. The first is
the output, `0.174`. Then, in `cinputs` order (depth, drive, level, rate,
tight, tone, trim): `0.107`, `0.443`, `0.804`, `0`, `0.397`, `0.0855`,
`0.482`. Three readings:

- **`rate` is exactly zero.** At `depth = 0` the tremolo is off, and its
  rate changes nothing. A descent would never move it: a flat direction,
  not a small gradient.
- **`level` and `trim` are one gain.** Their columns stand in the ratio of
  their ranges, `0.804 / 0.482 = 40 / 24`: per decibel, the two derivatives
  are the same signal. No loss can tell them apart, and learning both only
  moves their sum.
- **`tone` moves the output little at this setting**: `0.0855` for its
  whole range of 7500 Hz, a tenth of `level`'s column. Its derivative is not
  zero, but a descent on it would be slow and noisy.

The map depends on the setting. With the tremolo on, `rate` comes alive:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
ct = library("controls.lib");
e = fi.highpass(1, hslider("tight", 80, 20, 400, 1))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("drive", 12, 0, 30, 0.1))) : ma.tanh
  : fi.lowpass(1, hslider("tone", 3000, 500, 8000, 1))
  : *(1 - hslider("depth", 0, 0, 1, 0.01) * (0.5 + 0.5 * sin(2 * ma.PI * os.phasor(1, hslider("rate", 4, 0.5, 10, 0.01)))))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("level", -6, -40, 0, 0.1)))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("trim", 0, -12, 12, 0.1)));
x = 0.3 * (0.7 * os.sawtooth(110) + 0.3 * no.noise);
on = ["depth": 0.5 -> e];
process = x : ct.gradient_fad(on) : _, par(i, ct.count(on), *(ct.range(i, on)));
```

The literal modulation `["depth": 0.5 -> e]` fixes the depth at 0.5; it is
no longer a control, and the six columns are drive, level, rate, tight,
tone, trim. With the same run, `rate` reads `1.06`, and the `peak` of its
column grows with the window: `2.93` over half a second, `6.02` over one,
`12.1` over two. The phase of the tremolo accumulates, so its derivative
with respect to the rate grows linearly with time. A sensitivity is a local
statement, and this one is local in time too: a rate is learned from a
short window, or through a loss that does not depend on the phase.

`ct.gradient_rad` answers another question. It differentiates the **sum** of
the outputs, so it is the tool for one scalar quantity of the output with
respect to every slider, in one sweep. Here, the output's energy, `y²`,
compared with the same derivative taken by `fad`:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
ct = library("controls.lib");
e = fi.highpass(1, hslider("tight", 80, 20, 400, 1))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("drive", 12, 0, 30, 0.1))) : ma.tanh
  : fi.lowpass(1, hslider("tone", 3000, 500, 8000, 1))
  : *(1 - hslider("depth", 0, 0, 1, 0.01) * (0.5 + 0.5 * sin(2 * ma.PI * os.phasor(1, hslider("rate", 4, 0.5, 10, 0.01)))))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("level", -6, -40, 0, 0.1)))
  : *(ba.db2linear(hslider("trim", 0, -12, 12, 0.1)));
x = 0.3 * (0.7 * os.sawtooth(110) + 0.3 * no.noise);
energy = e : \(y).(y * y);
process = x <: ct.gradient_rad(energy), (ct.gradient_fad(energy) : !, si.bus(ct.count(e)));
```

The columns are the energy, its seven `rad` lanes, then its seven `fad`
lanes. As in section 10.5, a `rad` lane is a per-sample contribution to the
gradient of the block, meaningful as a sum over the block. Run with
`--block 4096 -n 8192 --out energy.npy` and sum each lane over each block
of 4096 samples:

- **first block**, from a cleared state: the two sets of sums agree to
  `1e-14`. The energy falls with `depth` (`-219.7`), rises with `drive`
  (`20.94`), does not depend on `rate` (`0`), and `level` and `trim` both
  give `29.18`, which is the block's energy (`126.7`) times
  `ln(10)/10 = 0.230259` to every printed digit: one decibel of energy per
  decibel of gain, exactly;
- **second block**: `drive` reads `20.196` by `rad` and `20.206` by `fad`,
  and `tight` `-0.7925` against `-0.7899`. The reverse sweep holds the state
  at the block's start (truncated BPTT, section 10.5); `fad` carries the
  whole history. The gains and the tremolo, which have no state, still
  agree.

So `gradient_fad` gives a per-sample sensitivity of every output to every
slider, the map above; `gradient_rad` gives the gradient of one scalar
summed over a block, for the cost of one sweep, which is the choice when
the sliders are many and the question is one number. Neither is a loss:
to learn the sliders, differentiate a loss of the output, which is what
`adaptive_fad` and `adaptive_rad` do (section 11.6, next).

### 11.6 Learning the sliders of an existing program

Section 11.5 read the sliders and measured what they do; learning them
needs a third primitive. The wildcard modulation `["*": (!, _) -> e]`
replaces every slider of `e` by an extra input, in the same order. The
modulator `(!, _)` drops the slider and passes the new input.

`op.adaptive_fad(e, loss, upd, clock, reset, x, t)` puts the three
primitives together with the clocked loop of section 11.2. It counts the controls, starts each
one at its default, rebinds them, and once per firing of `clock` takes one
step on the frame mean of their `fad` gradients, each parameter bounded by
its slider's range. Its outputs are those of `e` on the learned parameters,
followed by the parameters in interface order. The rebound sliders leave the
interface.

The program to learn is the two-slider chain of section 11.5, and the
target is the same chain at 2500 Hz and gain 1.2. First, the
`adaptive_fad` call as the library documentation gives it, with one Adam
rate for both sliders:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
e = fi.lowpass(1, hslider("cutoff", 1000, 50, 5000, 1)) : *(hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01));
x = 0.3 * no.noise;
target = x : fi.lowpass(1, 2500) : *(1.2);
upd = op.adam_g(0.01, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8);
process = op.adaptive_fad(e, op.mse, upd, il.frame_clock(256), 0, x, target) : \(y, cutoff, gain).(cutoff, gain, y - target);
```

Run with `-n 80000 --every 10000`. The cutoff reads `1000.40` at 10 000
samples, `1002.00` at 50 000 and `1002.73` at 70 000: Adam moves it by about
its rate, 0.01 Hz per step. The gain does not stop at 1.2. It reads `0.875`,
`1.585` and `1.631`, making up for the missing treble with level. The
residual is still `0.035` rms over the last 10 000 samples. This is section
5.1 again, on a real program: one rate for two units, and a wrong compromise
the loss accepts.

The remedy is also the one from section 5: give each slider a rate in its
own units. `cinput` gives the range, so 1 % of it per step can be written
once for any program:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
il = library("interleave.lib");
e = fi.lowpass(1, hslider("cutoff", 1000, 50, 5000, 1)) : *(hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01));
x = 0.3 * no.noise;
target = x : fi.lowpass(1, 2500) : *(1.2);
N = outputs(cinputs(e));
range(i) = cinput(i, e) : !, !, \(lo, hi).(hi - lo), !;
upd = par(i, N, op.adam_g(0.01 * range(i), 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8));
process = op.adaptive_fad(e, op.mse, upd, il.frame_clock(256), 0, x, target) : \(y, cutoff, gain).(cutoff, gain, y - target);
```

Same run. The cutoff reads `2574.69` at 10 000, `2500.47` at 40 000 and
`2499.98` at 60 000, and the gain `1.1752`, `1.1998` and `1.200001`. Over the
last 10 000 samples they are `2500.0005` and `1.1999997`, and the residual is
`2.4e-8` rms. `upd` is a list of `N` engines, one per control in `cinputs`
order. It can also be a single engine, as above, or engines of different
kinds. `controls.lib` packages the pattern: `ct.by_range(f, k, e)` is `f`
applied to `k` times the range of each control, so the list above is
`ct.by_range(\(lr).(op.adam_g(lr, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8)), 0.01, e)`.

Three remarks:

- `reset`, here 0, sends every parameter back to its default when it is
  non-zero; `button("reset")` gives the host that button.
- When the host should take the steps (`faustprobe --train`, section 10.4),
  `fad(loss, cinputs(e))` or `rad(loss, cinputs(e))` gives the gradient with
  respect to every slider of `e` directly.
- What the operator removes is the rewriting, not the modelling. The
  coordinates, the rates and what the output can identify remain the
  model's. Two gains in series are still one gain (the `level` and `trim`
  columns of section 11.5), a slider whose column is zero at the start
  (`rate` at `depth = 0`) does not move, and a function that is not
  differentiable at a slider's default (for example `abs` at 0) still
  stops the descent there. Measuring the map first says which of these
  to expect.

`adaptive_rad` has the same form with one reverse sweep instead of `N`
tangents, worth it past a few dozen controls. Through a recursion, though, it
sees only the direct term (section 10.5): on a filter, use `adaptive_fad`.
Example 15 of [ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md) learns the six
sliders of a drive pedal this way; its `mid_gain` starts at −3 dB rather
than 0, where the peak's magnitude does not depend on `mid_freq`
(section 11.5).

## 12. When the start is wrong

Everything so far started close enough to the answer. This section is
about what happens when it does not: the loss has several basins, or a
plateau, or the parameter has no derivative at all. The tools are those
of section 9 of the overview; every program below is run as the others,
and its figures checked by the test suite.

### 12.1 The landscape before the optimizer

A loss with two wells, `(p² - 1)² + 0.3 p`: a shallow one at `p = 0.96`
(loss 0.29) and a deep one at `p = -1.04` (loss -0.31), with a barrier
between them at `p = 0.04`. Gradient descent ends in the well it starts in:

```faust
op = library("optimizers.lib");
loss(p) = (p * p - 1.0) * (p * p - 1.0) + 0.3 * p;
process = op.descend_1D(loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, 1.0, 0), op.descend_1D(loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, -1.0, 0);
```

Run with `-n 4000 --every 1000`: from `p = 1` the first loop settles at
`0.960150`, from `p = -1` the second at `-1.035579`, and neither will ever
cross the barrier. Where you start decides what you find; the rest of this
section is about choosing the start, or moving it.

### 12.2 Starting from an estimate

The strongest tool is an outside estimate. The waveguide string of
`ddsp-examples` has a well ±1 Hz wide around its pitch, captured from above
only; instead of guessing a start, observe the target for `T` samples,
freeze an estimate of its pitch (here the peak lag of the target's
autocorrelation over a grid of lags from 161 to 279 Hz, shortened by 2 % to
land on the side the well captures from) with `init_latch`, hold the loop
at that moving `init` with `init_reset`, and release it at `T`:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = 0.1 * no.noise;
string(d, g, s) = (+(s) : de.fdelay4(512, d - 1.0) : *(g) : si.smooth(0.3)) ~ _;
target = string(ma.SR / 220.0, 0.95, x);
mdl(d, s) = string(d, 0.95, s);
acf(k) = op.ema(0.999, target * (target @ (158 + 4 * k)));
lanes = par(k, 30, (acf(k), float(158 + 4 * k)));
pick(bv, bl, v, l) = select2(v > bv, bv, v), select2(v > bv, bl, l);
best_lag = lanes : seq(i, 29, (pick, si.bus(2 * (28 - i)))) : !, _;
T = 8192.0;
init = op.init_latch(T, best_lag * 0.98);
d = op.lsq_1D(mdl, op.nlms(0.02, 1e-6, 0.99), 100, 400, init, op.init_reset(T), target, x);
process = ma.SR / d, ma.SR / init;
```

Run with `-n 60000 --every 12000`: the init lane holds `222.772277 Hz`
from sample 8 192 on; the pitch reads `223.30` at 12 000, `219.998` at
24 000 and `220.000007` at 48 000, with no start chosen by hand. The thirty
lags cost thirty smoothed products, not thirty models.

### 12.3 Leaving a shallow well with noise

`langevin_g` is the SGD step plus a noise of standard deviation
`sqrt(2 lr temp)`: at a fixed temperature the parameter samples
`exp(-loss / temp)` instead of settling, and with the temperature annealed
to zero it explores while hot and descends once cold. On the two wells,
from the shallow one:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
loss(p) = (p * p - 1.0) * (p * p - 1.0) + 0.3 * p;
noise = no.noise * sqrt(3.0);
temp = op.ramp_exp(0.5, 0.0, 20000.0);
p_sgd = op.descend_1D(loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, 1.0, 0);
p_langevin = op.descend_1D(loss, op.langevin_g(0.01, temp, noise), -3, 3, 1.0, 0);
p_cold = op.descend_1D(loss, op.langevin_g(0.01, 0.0, noise), -3, 3, 1.0, 0);
process = p_sgd, p_langevin, p_cold;
```

Run with `-n 200000 --every 40000`: SGD stays at `0.960150`; Langevin, with
`temp` going from 0.5 to 0 with a 20 000-sample time constant, crosses the
barrier while hot (`-0.899` at 40 000, still jittering) and cools into the
deep well, `-1.03557` on average over the last 20 000 samples; the third
lane, Langevin at temperature 0, is SGD bit for bit. Noise leaves a
shallow well; it does not pull on a flat plateau, and it does not choose
the deepest well with certainty.

### 12.4 Several starts

When no estimate is at hand, start from several places. `multistart_1D`
runs `K` descents in parallel and follows the one whose smoothed loss is
lowest; `grid_then_descend_1D` scores `K` fixed candidates for `T` samples
with no tangent, then runs one descent from the best; `grid_init(K, lo,
hi)` spreads the starts over the bounds:

```faust
op = library("optimizers.lib");
loss(p) = (p * p - 1.0) * (p * p - 1.0) + 0.3 * p;
process = op.multistart_1D(4, op.grid_init(4, -3.0, 3.0), loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, 0.999, 0),
          op.grid_then_descend_1D(8, 2000, op.grid_init(8, -3.0, 3.0), loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, 0);
```

Run with `-n 12000 --every 2000`: of the four descents from -2.25, -0.75,
0.75 and 2.25, the two from the left end in the deep well and the loop
follows one of them, `-1.035579` with index `1` (their losses are equal to
rounding, so the index may read 0 or 1); the grid scores its eight cells
for 2 000 samples, picks the one at -1.125 (index `2`, the held output
reads `-1.116`, the cell minus one step), and the descent from it settles
at `-1.035579` by 4 000.

The same on the string, in least-squares form with four starts, only one
of which is in the capture zone:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = 0.1 * no.noise;
string(d, g, s) = (+(s) : de.fdelay4(512, d - 1.0) : *(g) : si.smooth(0.3)) ~ _;
target = string(ma.SR / 220.0, 0.95, x);
mdl(d, s) = string(d, 0.95, s);
init(k) = ma.SR / ba.take(k + 1, (176.0, 200.0, 228.0, 264.0));
learned = op.multistart_lsq_1D(4, init, mdl, op.nlms(0.02, 1e-6, 0.99), 100, 400, 0.999, 0, target, x);
process = ma.SR / (learned : _, !), (learned : !, _);
```

Run with `-n 80000 --every 16000`: the index is `2`, the start at 228 Hz,
from 16 000 samples on, and the pitch `219.995` at 16 000, `220.000005` at
48 000. Four strings and their tangents compile in some 60 ms. A grid would
not have found this well: ±1 Hz wide over a range of 110 to 441 Hz, it
would need hundreds of cells.

### 12.5 Restarting when nothing progresses

For the cost of one model, `descend_1D_restart` walks a sequence of starts:
when the smoothed loss is above `eps_l` and has not fallen by `rel` over
the last `W` samples (checked from `2 W` after a start, the parameter held
during the first `W` while the model settles), the deviation is zeroed and
the next start is taken. On the two wells, from the shallow one:

```faust
op = library("optimizers.lib");
loss(p) = (p * p - 1.0) * (p * p - 1.0) + 0.3 * p;
init(k) = select2(k, 1.0, -1.0);
process = op.descend_1D_restart(2, init, loss, op.sgd_g(0.01), -3, 3, 4000, 0.05, 0.1, 0);
```

Run with `-n 30000 --every 3000`: index `0` and `p = 1` held until 4 000,
then `0.960150` in the shallow well; at 8 000 the loss (0.29, above
`eps_l = 0.1`) has not moved for 4 000 samples, the loop takes the second
start, `p = -1`, index `1`, and settles at `-1.035579` by 15 000, where the
loss is below `eps_l` and no further restart fires. The test is progress,
not a small gradient: on the string, the gradient is *larger* on the
plateau than in the well. And a start taken after a drift is not a fresh
loop: on the string, the model, its tangent and the engine keep the
drift's state, and a restart from 228 Hz does not lock the way a fresh
loop from 228 Hz does; the two-well loss has no such memory.

### 12.6 Learning without a gradient

Some parameters have no derivative: an integer delay length, a `select2`,
a written table. `fad` gives them a zero tangent and no loop of the
previous sections can move them. `spsa_1D_clocked` evaluates the loss at
`p + c` and `p - c` over each frame (the same excitation for both) and
hands `(L+ - L-) / 2c` to an ordinary engine, once per frame. A comb
`x + x @ 200` on a low-passed noise, its delay an integer:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise : fi.lowpass(1, 200.0);
target = x + (x @ 200);
mdl(d) = x + de.delay(512, int(d), x);
loss(d) = op.mse(mdl(d), target);
clock = ((+(1) : %(256)) ~ _) == 0;
d = op.spsa_1D_clocked(clock, loss, op.adam_g(0.5, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8), 2.0, 0, 500, 160, 0);
process = int(d), (fad(mdl(d), d) : !, _);
```

Run with `-n 60000 --every 10000`: the second lane, the `fad` tangent of
the model with respect to `d`, is identically `0`; the first, `int(d)`,
goes 160, 170, 187, 199, and reads `200` from 40 000 on: the hidden delay,
found by two evaluations per frame. `search_1D_clocked`, the (1+1)
evolution strategy, does without an engine: a candidate `p + sigma u` per
frame, kept when its loss is lower. On a discrete choice:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = no.noise;
mdl(p) = select2(p > 0.5, 0.2 * x, 0.7 * x);
loss(p) = op.mse(mdl(p), 0.7 * x);
clock = ((+(1) : %(64)) ~ _) == 0;
process = op.search_1D_clocked(clock, loss, 1.0, -2, 2, 0, 0), op.descend_1D(loss, op.sgd_g(0.5), -2, 2, 0, 0);
```

Run with `-n 6000 --every 1000`: the search reads `0.825585` from 1 000
on, on the branch that matches (the loss there is 0); `descend_1D` reads
`0` throughout, the tangent through the comparison being zero.

### 12.7 Widening the basin with the loss

The last tool changes the landscape itself. `bank_log_energy_loss`
compares smoothed log energies per band of a band-pass bank, the
filter-bank form of the multi-resolution spectral loss: it ignores phase,
so on the string the waveform's ±1 Hz well becomes a slope toward 220 Hz
from about 218 to 226 Hz (the sweep of `tests/corpus/opt_landscape_string.dsp`,
in section 5 of the overview). Learning through it from 224 Hz, next to
the waveform error:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
op = library("optimizers.lib");
x = 0.1 * no.noise;
string(d, g, s) = (+(s) : de.fdelay4(512, d - 1.0) : *(g) : si.smooth(0.3)) ~ _;
target = string(ma.SR / 220.0, 0.95, x);
mdl(d, s) = string(d, 0.95, s);
bank(d) = op.bank_log_energy_loss(8, 150.0, 4800.0, 0.999, 1e-9, mdl(d, x), target);
d_bank = op.descend_1D(bank, op.sgd_g(0.0001), 100, 400, ma.SR / 224.0, 0);
d_wave = op.lsq_1D(mdl, op.nlms(0.02, 1e-6, 0.99), 100, 400, ma.SR / 224.0, 0, target, x);
process = ma.SR / d_bank, ma.SR / d_wave;
```

Run with `-n 300000 --every 50000`: through the bank loss the pitch reads
`223.25` at 50 000, `220.04` at 100 000 and `220.000000` on average over
the last 20 000 samples; the rate is 1e-4, under the `1 - a = 1e-3` of the
loss's smoothing, as in section 7.2 (5e-4 oscillates). The honest half:
the waveform error reaches `220.000000` from 224 Hz too, carried by the
slope of its plateau, and from 200 or 214 Hz both fail, the bank's
landscape having local extrema where the harmonics of the two strings
align. The widening is real; on this string it buys no start the waveform
error cannot handle. `corr_loss` removes the plateau's slope but is no
wider, and `frame_spectral_loss` is the per-frame form for an `ondemand`
body, as in section 11.3.

## 13. Where to go next

- **Adaptive effects.** Section 6 of
  [docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md](../docs/fad-rad-synthesis-en.md) is an
  active-noise-control loop (FxLMS) written with `fad`; the corpus file
  `tests/corpus/auto_wah_fad_host.dsp` is an auto-wah whose gradients are
  exposed to the host.
- **Spectral losses.** `tests/corpus/ondemand_fad_spectral_loss_008.dsp`
  differentiates a loss computed on an FFT frame, the per-frame counterpart of
  section 7.2.
- **Complete examples.** [ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md): fifteen
  DDSP programs with their tests — an adaptive notch, a mode calibrated by
  Gauss-Newton, an amp model, a diode clipper learned through its implicit
  solver, an FDN reverb, a string tuned through its fractional delay
  (`fad`); an echo canceller, a neural waveshaper, block gradients for a
  host, a GRU amp trained by block BPTT, a harmonic synthesizer fitted
  through a spectral loss inside an `ondemand` block (`rad`); a reverb that
  calibrates itself, then stops paying for it (`gated`, `on_change`); a
  drive pedal that learns its six sliders from a recording without being
  rewritten (`adaptive_fad`).
- **Many parameters.** `tests/corpus/opt_descend_n_rad_fir16.dsp` and
  `tests/corpus/opt_lsq_n_rad_nlms_fir8.dsp` are the bus loops on FIRs;
  `tests/corpus/opt_bus_fad_vs_rad_fir16.dsp` runs the forward and the
  reverse version side by side.
- **Reverse mode and hosts.** [docs/rad-note-en.md](../docs/rad-note-en.md)
  for the algorithm, [docs/rad-usage-en.md](../docs/rad-usage-en.md) for the
  workflow.
- **When the start is wrong.** Section 9 of
  [optimizers-overview-en.md](optimizers-overview-en.md) on what gradient
  descent asks of the landscape, and section 12 above for the tools, one
  program each.
- **The library itself.** Every function of
  [optimizers.lib](optimizers.lib) carries a `#### Test` example that is
  compiled by the test suite; they are the smallest working usage of each
  function.

## 14. Frequently hit walls

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The parameter never moves | its derivative is zero: it passes through a button, a checkbox, an integer cast or comparison inside the model | keep the parameter path in floating-point arithmetic |
| It moves the wrong way | sign convention: with `r = model - target` the MSE gradient is `+2 r j`; the synthesis note uses `err = target - model` and `-err * j` | pick one convention |
| `NaN` after a while | `abs` (derivative `x/\|x\|`) or a filter that went unstable | smooth losses (`logcosh`, `pseudo_huber`), reflection coefficients for poles |
| One parameter converges, another crawls | different units under one learning rate | log domain, Adam/Lion, or `lm_2D` |
| The loop oscillates with an energy loss | the optimizer is faster than the loss's smoothing | lower `lr` below `1 - a` |
| Jitter at the end | fixed step size on a noisy gradient | `lr_exp`/`lr_cos`, `polyak`, or SGD instead of Adam |
| `(a, b) = f(...)` does not parse | Faust has no destructuring | `a = f(...) : _, !; b = f(...) : !, _;` |
| `mdl(opts)` has the wrong arity | a multi-output expression is one argument | project each output and pass them separately |
| Convergence in double but not in float | precision loss in recursive tangents | compile with `-double` |
| `sequential composition mismatch` around an `ondemand` block | a frame operator with free `_` inputs used several times | give the body named arguments, one per frame sample |
| A block ignores what happens outside | a definition referenced in the body is instantiated again in the body's time, it is not the outer signal | pass outer signals as explicit inputs of the block |
| A bus loop learns nothing, the taps random-walk near zero | `op.mse(_, t)` (any function applied to a free `_`) is a two-input block: `:>` splits the taps between its inputs | name the loss input: `\(y).(op.mse(y, t))` |
| A `_rad` loop converges slower than the `fad` one on a recursive model | inside a loop `rad` returns the direct term, the past state held fixed | the `fad` loops for recursive models, either for feed-forward ones |
| It drifts away instead of converging, the loss staying high | the wrong basin: a well too narrow for the start, or a sloped plateau | an estimate as `init` (12.2), several starts (12.4), a restart on no progress (12.5), a loss that widens the well (12.7) |
| It never moves although the loss is high | the parameter has no derivative: an integer delay, a `select2`, a written table | `spsa_1D_clocked` or `search_1D_clocked` (12.6) |
| `multistart` hesitates between two loops | their smoothed losses are equal to rounding, the same well reached twice | read the parameter, not the index; or fewer starts |
| A learned slider jumps to its bound on the first step and stays there | the model goes through a function that is not differentiable at the slider's default: `fi.peak_eq` takes `abs` of its gain, whose derivative at 0 dB is not a number | a smooth equivalent (`fi.peak_eq_rm`) or another default (11.6) |
| The `fad` slope of an implicit solver misses a term | the iteration starts from `vprev`, the very signal the equation holds fixed: `fad(G(vprev, v), v)` with `v = vprev` differentiates both | start the iteration from a predictor or any distinct signal |

## Glossary

- **Model**: the Faust expression whose parameters are learned.
- **Target**: the signal the model should produce.
- **Loss**: a scalar measure of the error at the current sample.
- **Gradient**: the derivative of the loss with respect to the parameters;
  **sensitivity** (`j`): the derivative of the model's output.
- **Seed**: the signal `fad` or `rad` differentiates with respect to. A seed
  is an unknown of its own: how it is computed is forgotten, so a seed
  computed from another seed passes nothing (section 2).
- **Tangent**: a derivative produced by forward-mode AD (`fad`).
- **Direct term**: the derivative of a recursive model's output with respect
  to a parameter, its past state held fixed; what `rad` returns inside a
  loop, and the pseudo-linear-regression gradient of adaptive filtering.
- **Engine**: the function that turns a gradient (or a residual and a
  sensitivity) into a step.
- **Learning rate** (`lr`): the step size; a **schedule** makes it vary.
- **Residual** (`r`): `model - target`.
- **Reparameterization**: learning a transformed parameter (a log, a
  reflection coefficient) so that every value is admissible.
