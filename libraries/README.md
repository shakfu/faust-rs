# Project-local Faust libraries

This directory contains Faust libraries that exercise `faust-rs` extensions
and are versioned with this repository:

- `optimizers.lib` (prefix `op`) provides in-graph optimization on top of
  `fad` and `rad`: update engines (LMS/NLMS, Adam and its variants, Lion,
  ...), losses and regularizers, reparameterizations (stable biquad poles
  from reflection coefficients), learning-rate schedules, one- to
  five-parameter least-squares and loss-first loops, damped Gauss-Newton
  loops, bus loops for `N` parameters in forward or reverse mode
  (`lsq_N_fad`/`lsq_N_rad`, `descend_N_fad`/`descend_N_rad`), clocked loops whose
  update runs once per firing of an `ondemand` clock, and a Newton solver.
  It imports `signals.lib`, `basics.lib`, `routes.lib` and `maths.lib`, so
  the Faust standard libraries must be on the import path too;
  `tests/corpus/opt_*.dsp` and `crates/compiler/tests/optimizers_lib.rs`
  exercise it (the tests skip when no faustlibraries checkout is found);
- `interleave.lib` provides frame-rate serialization around `ondemand` blocks;
- `controls.lib` (prefix `ct`) works on the control inputs of a whole program
  without rewriting it, with the `cinputs`/`cinput` primitives and the `"*"`
  modulation target: readers of each control's default, range and step, a
  generic `map`, smoothing, CV inputs, normalized or external parameters,
  rebuilt interfaces (`knobs`, `relabel`), preset morphing, randomizing,
  shifted copies, sweeps for testing, and gradients with respect to every
  control. It imports nothing; `tests/corpus/ctl_*.dsp` and
  `crates/compiler/tests/controls_lib.rs` exercise it, and
  [`../docs/control-inputs-en.md`](../docs/control-inputs-en.md)
  ([`fr`](../docs/control-inputs-fr.md)) describes the uses.

Add this directory to the Faust import search path when compiling a DSP that
uses one of them:

```sh
faust-rs -I libraries -I <faustlibraries> -lang cpp program.dsp
cargo run -p compiler -- --check program.dsp -I libraries -I <faustlibraries>
```

The library source keeps ordinary basename imports, for example
`op = library("optimizers.lib")`, `import("optimizers.lib")` or
`il = library("interleave.lib")`.

Three companion documents introduce `optimizers.lib` to readers new to
machine learning and differentiable DSP, in English and French:

- [optimizers-overview-en.md](optimizers-overview-en.md) /
  [optimizers-overview-fr.md](optimizers-overview-fr.md) — what `fad`/`rad`
  bring to differentiable DSP, how the library is organized, where each
  algorithm comes from and why it was chosen, measured behaviour, pitfalls,
  and what gradient descent asks of a non-convex loss landscape;
- [optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-en.md](optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-en.md) /
  [optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-fr.md](optimizers-ddsp-tutorial-fr.md) — a
  step-by-step tutorial, from a hand-written gradient to a five-coefficient
  biquad, every program run with `faustprobe` and its quoted figures kept
  true by `crates/cranelift-ffi/tests/tutorial_examples.rs`;
- [ddsp-examples-en.md](ddsp-examples-en.md) /
  [ddsp-examples-fr.md](ddsp-examples-fr.md) — fifteen complete DDSP programs
  (`tests/corpus/ddsp_*.dsp`, run by `crates/compiler/tests/ddsp_examples.rs`):
  an adaptive notch, a mode calibrated by Gauss-Newton, an amp model, a
  diode clipper learned through its implicit Newton solver, an FDN reverb
  calibrated to a target decay and a waveguide string tuned through its
  fractional delay with `fad`; a 64-tap echo canceller, a neural waveshaper,
  block gradients handed to a host, a GRU amp model trained by
  block-truncated BPTT from the host and a harmonic synthesizer fitted
  through a per-frame spectral loss inside an `ondemand` block with `rad`;
  a string that tunes itself from its own pitch estimate (`init_latch`), an
  integer delay learned without a gradient (`spsa_1D_clocked`), and a drive
  pedal that learns its six sliders from a recording without being rewritten
  (`adaptive_fad`).

The libraries follow the Faust libraries documentation conventions
(<https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/contributing/>): a `declare name`/`version`
header, section banners, and one documented block per public function with
`Usage`, `Where`, `Test` and `References` entries.
