# faust-rs impulse-response tests

This is a faust-rs port of the C++ Faust `tests/impulse-tests` machinery. It
checks that faust-rs backends generate correct code by comparing the impulse
response of each test DSP against a **reference** produced by the genuine C++
Faust compiler.

See the design write-up in
[`porting/impulse-tests-harness-port-plan-2026-06-14-en.md`](../../porting/impulse-tests-harness-port-plan-2026-06-14-en.md).

## What it does

1. **Reference (the oracle).** `make reference` compiles every `dsp/*.dsp` with
   the C++ Faust compiler wrapped in the original 4-pass impulse architecture
   (`impulsearch.cpp` + `controlTools.h`), builds a native binary, and runs it
   for 60000 frames: impulse pass + random-split pass + polyphonic 4-voice pass
   + polyphonic 1-voice pass. Output goes to `reference/*.ir`.

2. **Backend checks.** Each backend target regenerates the impulse response with
   faust-rs and compares it to the reference with `tools/filesCompare`
   (tolerance `2e-06`):
   - `make cpp` / `make c` — faust-rs generates C++/C, it is wrapped in the
     *same* 4-pass architecture, compiled and run; the full 60000-frame output
     is compared **exactly**.
   - `make interp` — the faust-rs interpreter runs in-process via
     `impulse-runner`. It has no polyphonic/MIDI runtime, so it reproduces only
     the scalar impulse pass (first 15000 frames) and is compared as a **prefix**
     with `filesCompare -part` (same approach the C++ suite uses for its Rust
     target).
   - `make cranelift` — the faust-rs Cranelift JIT runs in-process via
     `impulse_cranelift` in 64-bit (`-double`), scalar prefix, `-part`.
   - `make wasm` — the faust-rs WASM backend is compiled to `.wasm + .json`
     and executed through Node's native WebAssembly runtime in 64-bit
     (`-double`), scalar prefix, `-part`.
   - `make assemblyscript` — the faust-rs AssemblyScript backend is compiled
     with `asc`, executed through Node's native WebAssembly runtime, and
     compared on the scalar prefix with `filesCompare -part`.
   - `make rust` — the faust-rs Rust backend is appended to the native Rust
     impulse architecture, compiled with `rustc -O`, and compared on the
     scalar prefix with `filesCompare -part` in 64-bit (`-double`) mode.
   - `make julia` — the faust-rs Julia backend is appended to a self-contained
     Julia impulse runtime, run by `julia`, and compared on the scalar prefix
     with `filesCompare -part` in 64-bit (`-double`) mode.
   - `make <backend>-vec0` / `make <backend>-vec1` — run the same backend with
     `-vec -lv 0` or `-vec -lv 1` respectively. Available for `cpp`, `c`,
     `interp`, `cranelift`, `wasm`, `assemblyscript`, `rust`, and `julia`; `make all-vec` runs
     both vector loop variants across all backends.
   - `make <backend>-ssN` / `make <backend>-vecL-ssN` — cross scalar mode or
     vector loop variant `L` with scheduling strategy `N`. `make all-ss` runs
     scalar `-ss 0..3`, `make all-vec-ss` runs `-lv 0/1 x -ss 0..3`, and
     `make backend-matrix` runs all 96 backend/mode/strategy combinations.

## Requirements

- A built faust-rs workspace: `make build` (builds `compiler`,
  `impulse-runner`, and the `impulse_cranelift` binary in release mode).
- A C++ Faust checkout for the reference oracle and the native C/C++ paths
  (architecture headers + `impulsearch.cpp`). Paths are configured in
  [`common.mk`](common.mk) and overridable:
  `CPP_TESTS`, `FAUST_ARCH`, `FAUST_CPP`, `FAUSTLIBS`.
- `c++` and the Faust standard libraries (default `/usr/local/share/faust`).
- Node.js for the WASM and AssemblyScript impulse runners.
- `rustc` (already required to build the workspace) for the Rust backend gate.
- Julia with the `StaticArrays` package for the Julia backend gate.
- `asc` (AssemblyScript compiler) on `PATH`, or `ASC=/path/to/asc`.
- The Node runners use a 600-second compiler timeout so heavily parallel
  backend-matrix runs do not inherit the interactive CLI's 120-second limit.
  Override it with
  `FAUST_RS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=<positive-seconds>`.

## Usage

```bash
cd tests/impulse-tests
make build         # build the faust-rs binaries the harness drives

make cranelift     # check the Cranelift JIT backend (64-bit)
make wasm          # check the WASM backend (64-bit scalar prefix)
make assemblyscript # check the AssemblyScript backend (scalar prefix)
make rust          # check the Rust backend (scalar prefix, rustc)

make cpp-vec1      # check the C++ backend with -vec -lv 1
make all-vec       # check -vec -lv 0 and -vec -lv 1 across all backends
make cpp-ss2       # check scalar C++ with scheduling strategy 2
make cpp-vec1-ss3  # check C++ with -vec -lv 1 -ss 3
make backend-matrix-smoke # run the representative backend matrix corpus
make backend-matrix       # run all 96 backend/mode/strategy combinations
make -j8 backend-matrix-full # fresh full matrix plus the audited report
make bench         # compare C++ Faust and faust-rs performance with faustbench -single
make vec-bench     # compare scalar/vec0/vec1 C++ throughput under -ss 0..3 for checked vector DSPs
make compile-bench # compare C++ Faust and faust-rs compile time
make all           # cpp + c + interp + cranelift + wasm + assemblyscript + rust
make -k -j8 cpp    # parallel, keep going past failures
make help          # list targets and variables
make clean         # remove ir/ and build/
```

There is no `reference` rebuild on every run: delete `reference/` (or
`make distclean`) to regenerate.

## Status

Raw sweep over the 93 DSPs at the default `2e-06` tolerance:

| Backend | Match | Mismatch | Compile-fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| C++ (full 4-pass, exact) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| C (full 4-pass, exact) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| interpreter (scalar prefix, `-part`) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| Cranelift JIT (scalar prefix, `-part`, 64-bit) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| WASM (scalar prefix, `-part`, 64-bit, Node) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| AssemblyScript (scalar prefix, `-part`, `asc` + Node) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| Rust (scalar prefix, `-part`, `rustc`) | **92** | 0 | 1 (`subcontainer1`) |
| Vector variants (`-vec -lv 0` / `-vec -lv 1`) | inherit backend gates |  |  |

The C++ backend reproduces the full 60000-frame reference exactly on 92/93 DSPs,
so the remaining mismatches are backend-specific divergences the harness
pinpoints. Each was classified by its *max* delta and either given a per-DSP
tolerance (bounded rounding) or listed as a known failure (real gap) in
[`known.mk`](known.mk) / [`KNOWN_FAILURES.md`](KNOWN_FAILURES.md). With those
applied, the aggregate targets are **green gates**: `make cpp` (92), `make c`
(92), `make cranelift` (92), `make interp` (92), `make wasm` (92), and
`make assemblyscript` (92), and `make rust` (92) build and pass. The vector-mode gates use suffixed
outdirs such as `cpp-vec0` / `cpp-vec1`, inherit the base backend known-failure
lists, and can be run per backend or together with `make all-vec`; excluded
cases are documented in `known.mk` to fix later.

The backend matrix uses separate outdirs such as `cpp-ss2` and
`wasm-vec1-ss3`. `BACKEND_MATRIX_SMOKE_DSPFILES` defaults to `APF`, `delays`, and
`select2`, covering recursion, delay storage, and conditional selection. The
full-corpus gate is `make -j8 backend-matrix`; `dspfiles` can also be overridden
explicitly for a targeted run.

`make -j8 backend-matrix-full` is the reproducible full gate. It removes only scheduling
matrix outdirs, executes all 6,624 comparisons from fresh artifacts, and writes
`porting/generated/p7-executable-backend-matrix-2026-07-14-en.md`. The report
checks every expected response and records one aggregate SHA-256 per
backend/mode/strategy combination.

## Performance Bench

`make bench` runs the impulse DSP corpus through `faustbench -single` twice:
once with `FAUST_CPP` and once with `FAUST_RS`. Because `faustbench` finds a
binary named `faust` on `PATH`, the target creates temporary wrappers under
`build/bench/` and writes:

- `build/bench/summary.csv` — DSP name, C++ Faust throughput, faust-rs
  throughput, and relative delta.
- `build/bench/logs/*.log` — full `faustbench` output for each compiler.

The default precision option is `BENCH_OPTIONS=-double`; the recipe also passes
`-I dsp -I $(FAUSTLIBS)`. Override as needed:

```bash
make bench BENCH_OPTIONS="-double -run 3" BENCH_WARN_MIN=10
```

`make vec-bench` keeps the `faust-rs` compiler and native C++ build settings
fixed and measures the 12 combinations formed by scalar, `-vec -lv 0`, and
`-vec -lv 1` crossed with `-ss 0..3`. It writes:

- `build/bench/vector-scheduling.csv` — one row per DSP/combination, including
  throughput, gain versus `scalar -ss 0`, and vector gain versus scalar at the
  same `-ss` value.
- `build/bench/vector-scheduling-summary.csv` — the fastest mode and scheduling
  strategy for each DSP.
- `build/bench/vector-scheduling-aggregate.csv` — arithmetic and geometric mean
  speedups, plus win counts, for each of the 12 mode/strategy combinations.
- `build/bench/logs/*.scalar.ss*.log` and `*.vec*.ss*.log` — raw faustbench
  output for every measurement.

The benchmark input is deliberately restricted to
`../vector-coverage/certified-dspfiles.txt`, the intersection certified by the
complete float/double, `-lv`, and `-ss` retention matrix. Consequently its
vector speedup aggregates cannot include scalar fallback modules. Regenerate
that list only through `cargo run -p xtask -- vector-coverage-merge` after an
intentional, reviewed coverage-baseline update.

This is a developer performance benchmark, not a correctness gate. Use several
runs and a fixed block size when comparing changes:

```bash
make vec-bench VEC_BENCH_OPTIONS="-double -run 5 -bs 512"
```

`make compile-bench` measures compiler wall-clock time on the same corpus. It
generates C++ with `-lang cpp -double` through both `FAUST_CPP` and
`FAUST_RS`, writes generated sources under `build/bench/compile/`, and records:

- `build/bench/compile-summary.csv` — DSP name, C++ Faust compile time,
  faust-rs compile time, and relative delta.
- `build/bench/logs/*.compile.*.log` — compiler stderr plus high-resolution
  wall-clock timing output.
