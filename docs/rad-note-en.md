# Reverse-Mode AD in `faust-rs`

Verified against the implementation and runtime tests on 2026-07-22.

Synthesis note describing the reverse-mode automatic differentiation
(RAD) pass implemented in `crates/propagate/src/reverse_ad.rs`, with
emphasis on the algorithm, the rule table, the temporal boundary, and
the relationship to the forward-mode pass.

## 1. Surface

`rad(expr, seeds)` is a two-child node mirroring `fad(expr, seeds)`.
It is a `faust-rs` extension; the C++ Faust reference compiler used by this
project does not currently recognize it.

```faust
x = hslider("x", 1, 0, 10, 0.01);
y = hslider("y", 2, 0, 10, 0.01);
loss = sin(x * y);
process = rad(loss, (x, y));
```

Output bundle layout:

```text
rad(expr, (s_0, …, s_{N-1})) =
    [ expr_0, expr_1, …, expr_{M-1},
      ∂ sum(expr_i) / ∂ s_0,
      ∂ sum(expr_i) / ∂ s_1,
      …,
      ∂ sum(expr_i) / ∂ s_{N-1} ]
```

The implicit cotangent on every primal output is `1.0` (sum cotangent).
Custom output cotangents are reserved for a future `vjp(expr, cotangent,
seeds)` primitive.

Arity contract:

- `body.outputs ≥ 1` (`PropagateError::RadBodyArity`),
- `seeds.outputs ≥ 1` (`PropagateError::RadSeedArity`),
- `inputs = max(body.inputs, seeds.inputs)`,
- `outputs = body.outputs + seeds.outputs`.

## 2. Algorithm

`reverse_ad.rs` performs three explicit passes on a single
`ReverseADTransform` instance.

### 2.1 Active subgraph collection

Postorder DFS from each primal output through the differentiable
children of every visited node. Descent stops at any `SigId` that
appears in the seed list, and DAG sharing is preserved by a `visited`
set so each node is visited at most once.

```text
collect_dfs(root):
  if seen(root):                          return
  if root ∈ seeds:                        record root, return
  for child in active_children(root):
    collect_dfs(child)
  postorder.push(root)
```

`active_children(sig)` reuses the same `match_sig` decoding as the
adjoint emission code, so a node that gets descended in pass (1) is
guaranteed to have a matching adjoint rule in pass (2).

### 2.2 Adjoint accumulation

Initialize each primal's adjoint to `1.0` (the sum cotangent), then
walk the postorder in reverse and emit local transpose contributions:

```text
for primal in primals:
  adjoints[primal] += 1.0

for y in reverse(postorder):
  if y ∈ seeds:                           continue           // leaf
  y_bar = adjoints[y]
  for (child, factor) in transpose_rule(y):
    adjoints[child] += y_bar · factor
```

`add_adjoint(target, contribution)` accumulates into the map: if
`target` already has an adjoint, it builds `old + contribution`;
otherwise it stores `contribution` directly. This is the structural
counterpart of the explicit-zero-fold step that FAD does at
construction time.

### 2.3 Seed extraction

```text
result = primals
for s in seeds:
  result.push(adjoints.get(s).unwrap_or(zero))
```

Repeated seed lanes preserve the same adjoint identity, so
`rad(a*b, (a, a))` yields two gradient lanes that alias the same
computed signal. Absent seeds (those never reached from any primal
output) yield `0.0`.

**A seed is detached.** Because the collection stops at a seed (§2.1) and
the accumulation skips it, no adjoint flows below a seed: each seed is
differentiated as an independent variable, and whatever computes it is a
constant for every lane. The block sweep (§4) keeps the same stop set. Put
plainly: a signal you list as a seed becomes an unknown of its own, and the
compiler forgets how it was computed; `rad(x + y, (x + y, x, y))` is read as a
body `u` with the three unknowns `u`, `x`, `y`. Two consequences, the same as
for `fad`:

- a seed that is a recursive state or a clamp of one (the parameters of the
  library's descents) gets the partial derivative of the loss with the other
  parameters fixed, and its own computation, the optimizer's recursion, is
  outside the loss: no carry leaks into it;
- a seed computed from another seed does not pass that seed's adjoint:
  `rad(x + y, (x + y, x, y))` gives `1, 0, 0`, not `1, 1, 1`. PyTorch's
  `autograd.grad(u, [u, x, y])` gives `(1, 1, 1)` because its backward pass
  does not stop at an input; faust-rs's seeds are JAX arguments, not PyTorch
  tensors, and the reason is the first bullet. The analysis is
  [`porting/fad-rad-seed-semantics-analysis-2026-09-21-en.md`](../porting/fad-rad-seed-semantics-analysis-2026-09-21-en.md).

*The diagnostic (2026-09-21).* A seed whose computation contains a
different seed is refused at the propagation of the seed box, with the same
code and shape as for `fad` (`FRS-PROP-0005`, `PropagateError::AdDependentSeed`,
`crates/propagate/src/dependent_seeds.rs`): "rad seed 1 `input 0 + input 1`
is computed from seed 2 `input 0`" for `err_rad_dependent_seed.dsp`, a note
saying which lanes would be 0 and that the adjoint does not pass through a
seed, and two `help` lines giving the two spellings, the seed list without
the dependent seed and the dependent seed alone. Duplicated seeds stay
legal, and the walk does not enter a recursion body nor cross a delay, so
the library's descents are not reported, nor `y'` seeded next to `y`.

## 3. Rule table

The transpose rules below mirror the forward rules in `forward_ad.rs`
for every family that admits a causal reverse pass. Notation:
`y` = visited node, `y_bar` = its accumulated adjoint, `child_bar +=
…` = `add_adjoint(child, …)`.

### 3.1 Leaves and discrete operators

| Node | Reverse behaviour |
|------|-------------------|
| `int(c)`, `real(c)` | no children |
| `sigInput(_)` | no children |
| `hslider`, `vslider`, `numentry` (not seed) | no children |
| `button`, `checkbox` | no children (discrete) |
| seed `s` | descent stops; final `adjoints[s]` is the gradient lane; nothing flows below `s`, so a seed computed from another seed passes no adjoint (§2.3) |
| comparisons / shifts / bitwise `BinOp` | no contribution |

Foreign constants and variables (`ma.SR`, `fvariable`) and the
clock-boundary variables `TempVar`/`PermVar` are leaves as well: external
scalars and a block's inputs are data, never on a seed path (the seeds of a
`rad` inside an `ondemand` body are the body's own signals).

### 3.2 Arithmetic `BinOp`

| `y = …` | Adjoint contributions |
|---------|-----------------------|
| `x + z` | `x_bar += y_bar`; `z_bar += y_bar` |
| `x - z` | `x_bar += y_bar`; `z_bar += -y_bar` |
| `x * z` | `x_bar += y_bar · z`; `z_bar += y_bar · x` |
| `x / z` | `x_bar += y_bar / z`; `z_bar += y_bar · (-x / z²)` |
| `x % z` | `x_bar += y_bar`; `z_bar += y_bar · -⌊x/z⌋` |

### 3.3 Unary trig/transcendental

The chain rule `child_bar += y_bar · f'(child)` is applied with the
same closed-form derivatives as FAD:

| `y = f(x)` | `f'(x)` |
|-----------|---------|
| `sin(x)` | `cos(x)` |
| `cos(x)` | `-sin(x)` |
| `tan(x)` | `1 / cos²(x)` |
| `exp(x)` | `exp(x)` |
| `log(x)` | `1 / x` |
| `log10(x)` | `1 / (x · ln 10)` |
| `sqrt(x)` | `1 / (2 · √x)` |
| `abs(x)` | `x / \|x\|` |
| `acos(x)` | `-1 / √(1 - x²)` |
| `asin(x)` | `1 / √(1 - x²)` |
| `atan(x)` | `1 / (1 + x²)` |

At non-differentiable points the emitted formula is not regularized. In
particular, the current `abs` rule can produce `NaN` at `x = 0` because it uses
`x / |x|`.

### 3.4 Binary math

| `y = f(x, z)` | Contribution to `x_bar` | Contribution to `z_bar` |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| `pow(x, z)` | `y_bar · pow(x,z) · z / x` | `y_bar · pow(x,z) · log(x)` |
| `atan2(y_n, x_n)` | `y_bar · -y_n / (x_n² + y_n²)` to `x_n` | `y_bar · x_n / (x_n² + y_n²)` to `y_n` |
| `min(x, z)` | `y_bar` if `x < z`, else `0` | `y_bar` if `x ≥ z`, else `0` |
| `max(x, z)` | `y_bar` if `x > z`, else `0` | `y_bar` if `x ≤ z`, else `0` |
| `fmod(x, z)` | `y_bar` | `y_bar · -⌊x/z⌋` |
| `remainder(x, z)` | `y_bar` | `y_bar · -round(x/z)` |

The branch routing for `min`/`max` is materialized via `select2`; the
condition itself receives no adjoint since it is a discrete branch
selector.

### 3.5 Control flow and casts

| Node | Reverse behaviour |
|------|-------------------|
| `select2(cond, x, z)` | `x_bar += select2(cond, y_bar, 0)`; `z_bar += select2(cond, 0, y_bar)`; `cond` receives nothing |
| `float_cast(x)` | `x_bar += float_cast(y_bar)` |
| `int_cast(x)` | no contribution (discontinuous truncation) |
| `bit_cast(x)` | unsupported representation-level operation; RAD rejects it |

The symbolic sweep and the `BlockReverseAD` sweep apply the same `int_cast`
rule, and FAD's tangent through `int` is zero too: `rad(int(10 * g)', g)`
gives 0, not the straight-through 10 that the block sweep returned before
2026-10-03. The block sweep also treats an int→real `float_cast` as a
boundary, so that no real adjoint enters integer arithmetic.

### 3.6 Read-only tables

For `y = rdtbl(T, idx)` where `T` is read-only (a `Waveform` or a
write-once `WrTbl(_, _, nil, nil)`), the table contents are treated as
constant data. RAD differentiates only through the read address using
the same symmetric finite-difference slope as FAD:

```text
y       = rdtbl(T, idx)
slope   = (rdtbl(T, idx + 1) - rdtbl(T, idx - 1)) / 2
idx_bar += y_bar · slope
```

Mutable tables (`WrTbl` with non-nil write ports) refuse adjoint and
raise `RadUnsupportedNode { kind: "writable-table" }`.

In practice the read index is an integer: `rdtable(n, t, int(phase))`, as
in `os.osc`, and signal promotion casts any other index. An integer index is
a gradient boundary, so the contribution above reaches nothing. In the
symbolic sweep, the `int_cast` that produced the index stops it. In the
`BlockReverseAD` sweep, which a temporal body such as `os.osc`'s phase
recursion routes to, `RdTbl` gives its integer index no adjoint at all, as an
int→real `float_cast` does, so that no real adjoint enters integer
arithmetic. FAD agrees: the tangent of an integer index is zero. A table read
on the primal path, such as an oscillator in the excitation, therefore costs
nothing in the backward sweep. The block sweep refuses a writable table, as
the symbolic sweep does.

### 3.7 Foreign functions

Recognised unary FFun families (precision-agnostic match on the
descriptor name):

| Name | Adjoint |
|------|---------|
| `tanh` | `y_bar · (1 - tanh²(x))` (reuses primal) |
| `sinh` | `y_bar · cosh(x)` rebuilt as `y_bar · √(1 + sinh²(x))` |
| `cosh` | `y_bar · sinh(x)` rebuilt as `y_bar · (e^x - e^{-x}) / 2` |
| `atanh` | `y_bar / (1 - x²)` |
| `asinh` | `y_bar / √(1 + x²)` |
| `acosh` | `y_bar / √(x² - 1)` |

Non-unary or unrecognised FFun calls raise
`RadUnsupportedNode { kind: "ffun" }`. The block sweep applies the same
table (`propagate_bra_ffun_adj`), taping the node's value for `tanh` and
`sinh` and the argument's for the others; an unrecognised foreign
function inside a temporal body is rejected with `FRS-SFIR-0004`.

### 3.8 Pass-through wrappers

`Attach`, `Enable`, `Control`, and `Output` are transparent to
differentiation: the adjoint is forwarded to the signal-carrying
operand only. Bargraphs (`vbargraph` / `hbargraph`) are metering
sinks — they are walked so seed-reachability is correctly classified
but propagate no adjoint.

`Clocked(env, x)` is passed through like `Attach`: inside an `ondemand`
body it wraps the boundary values, and the adjoint flows to the payload.

## 4. Temporal boundary

Forward-mode AD applies a causal rule for delays:

```text
∂ delay1(x) / ∂p = delay1(x')         // tangent at frame n depends on frame n-1
```

Reverse-mode AD requires the transpose, which is anti-causal:

```text
adj_x[n] += adj_y[n + 1]              // adjoint at frame n depends on a future frame
```

A correct reverse pass therefore needs either

- a finite block tape that buffers primal intermediates and a backward
  scan over that block, or
- a causal approximation that is explicitly not exact reverse mode.

Current RAD takes the finite-block route through `SigBlockReverseAD`.
The local symbolic sweep remains feed-forward only: when it reaches a
delay, prefix, recursion, or IIR carrier, it raises
`PropagateError::RadUnsupportedNode` with a kind label. The public
`generate_rad_signals` dispatcher catches the temporal/recursive kinds
and emits a `BlockReverseAD` carrier instead of surfacing the diagnostic.
Hard unsupported families such as mutable tables, soundfiles, and
unrecognized foreign functions still surface targeted diagnostics.

The `BlockReverseAD` lowering evaluates the primal body forward over
the current `compute(count)` block, records the intermediate values it
needs in BRA tapes (real-valued, plus one integer tape per `select2`
condition and per delay amount, each `-bra-tape N` samples long, 8192 by
default: a longer block wraps the tape index and the gradients of its
tail are wrong), then runs the backward sweep over that same block. The
gradient lanes are per-sample contributions for the block-local
objective; users can sum them over the block or reduce them in DSP code
with a block length such as `ma.BS`.

A value is taped only when a backward rule needs it and it is not
trivially re-evaluable in the reverse loop: a stateless expression of
constants, inputs, controls and foreign constants is recomputed there
(and hoisted out of the loop like any control expression), whatever the
operators on the way, `min`/`max`/`pow`/`atan2`/`fmod`/`select2`
included. This matters for filter coefficients: `ma.SR` is
`min(192000, max(1, fconstant(...)))` in the standard library, so a
criterion that stopped at `min`/`max` taped every coefficient computed
from the sample rate, per sample, 21 tapes for one RBJ biquad section
instead of 5 (`x`, `x'`, `x''`, `y'`, `y''`), and 4449 tapes for a
16-line FDN with 170 sections, 1391 after. Two signals that lower to the
same FIR value (the slot of a recursion read inside its body through
`SYMREF` and outside it through `SYMREC`) share one tape. The tapes are
the memory of a `rad` over a long block, `N` samples per tape; the
Cranelift `dsp*` layout is 64-bit, so an instance can hold more than 4 GB
of them (a 7-second response at 48 kHz, `-bra-tape 524288`, is 5.8 GB
for that FDN).

The carry of a feedback tap, `Delay1(Proj(slot, SYMREF))` or
`Delay(c, Proj(slot, SYMREF))`, is loaded at the next reverse step into the
adjoint of the slot it reads: the `Proj(slot, SYMREC)` node when the carrier
reads that slot outside the recursion, else the slot's body itself. The
second case is a coefficient routed through the `~` block as a wire, the
shape of `(+, _) ~ *` and of the IIR of Rushton's AES 2025 paper
(`rad_iir_transposed.dsp`), where the body reads the coefficient only
through its tap; the postorder is closed over such slots
(`collect_bra_postorder_closed`) so the body is walked and the seed under
it gets its adjoint. Before that closure the carry landed nowhere and the
coefficient's gradient was zero (2026-09-23).

A `Delay(d, x)` whose amount is not a literal, a slider-driven integer
constant over the block or a signal that varies within it, is a scatter
rather than a fixed shift: `y[n] = x[n - d[n]]`, so `adj[x][n - d[n]] +=
adj[y][n]`. The reverse step `n` accumulates `adj[y][n]` into slot
`(n - d[n]) % S` of an `S = D + 1` slot buffer, `D` the bound of the
amount (its interval, the bound that sizes the forward delay line), and
`adj[x][n]` reads slot `n % S`, then clears it: the targets still to be
read at step `n` are the `D + 1` consecutive indices `n - D ..= n`, whose
residues are distinct. `d[n] == 0` contributes at the same step, a target
before the block is dropped (the block is the horizon), and `d[n]` is
replayed from its tape when it is not trivially re-evaluable. The amount
itself gets no adjoint (an integer). A non-literal amount used to be read
as zero, the delay treated as the identity, and the gradients through a
recursion holding such a delay were silently wrong. A delay with a
non-literal amount read *directly* on a recursion output
(`Delay(d, Proj(SYMREF))`, which the normalizer does not produce for `~`:
the feedback path reads `Delay1(Proj)`) is rejected with a diagnostic
rather than approximated.

Seeds are leaves of the block sweep exactly as they are of the symbolic
sweep: the postorder records a seed and does not descend into whatever
computes it, and no adjoint flows below it. A seed may therefore be the
output of a clamp, of a `select2` initialisation gate, or of an
optimizer's own recursion, and the block sweep neither rejects that
computation nor leaks a carry into it. `select2` inside the body follows
the symbolic rule (§3.5): the adjoint is routed to the branch that was
taken at that sample, the condition being replayed from its tape.

The carry of a recursion lands on its output wherever that output sits
in the body. A loss is rarely the recursive output itself: `(y -
target)^2`, `select2(t, y * y, ...)`, `2 * y` all keep `y = proj(0,
rec)` as an interior node. Before the reverse walk, the sweep pre-seeds
`adj[y[n]]` with the carry `adj[y[n+1]] · ∂y[n+1]/∂y[n]` stored by the
previous reverse step, keyed by recursion variable and slot, for every
real-valued projection of the postorder. Integer recursions in the body
(an LCG noise source, a counter) have no temporal derivative and get no
carry. Matching only carrier roots, as the sweep first did, cut the
adjoint chain through time for every loss with an interior recursive
output: each sample kept its direct term only, which the convergence
fixtures did not notice and a finite-difference check does (6.7 vs 29.7
for `rad(y * y, c)` with `y = c : + ~ sin`).

A feedback tap is `Delay1(Proj(SYMREF))`, a chain `Delay1(Delay1(..))`
for `y[n-2]` (`mem`, `fi.tf2`), or `Delay(c, Proj(SYMREF))` for `y@c`.
The first and the last are pre-seeded into `adj[Proj(SYMREC)]` from
their carry -- a scalar, or a circular buffer of `c` slots -- before
the walk. In a chain the adjoint of the inner delay *is* the carry
loaded by the outer one, and every carry load is snapshotted into a
stack temporary before the step's stores (`snapshot_bra_carry`): a
plain read of the field, consumed only by the inner store in
post-output, saw the value the outer store had just written, which
cut every two-pole block gradient to about half.

A carrier whose public projections are all gradients -- `rad(loss, p) :
!, _` -- has no primal output to drive its forward pass. The lowering
collects such carriers under the reverse-time outputs
(`bra_groups_of_reverse_outputs`), opens the forward slice for them and
runs `ensure_bra_forward_pass`: the body is lowered at the top level
and its tapes are planned there, so the reverse loop reads a taped
primal instead of a recursion it cannot recompute backwards. The
gradient lanes of `rad(loss, p) : !, _` are those of `rad(loss, p)` with
the primal dropped.

Where the sweep runs decides its horizon. A public gradient output is
lowered in the reverse loop, which walks the block backwards: the carry
stored at one step is the adjoint of the next sample, and the gradient
is the block-local one described above. A gradient consumed inside the
graph -- `p_next = p - lr * (rad(loss(p), p) : !, _)` in an adaptation
recursion -- is lowered in the forward loop, at the sample that consumes
it: the horizon is that sample, the past state of the body is held
fixed, and the gradient is the direct term (`2 (y - t) y[n-1]` for a
one-pole: the pseudo-linear-regression gradient of adaptive IIR
filtering), not the derivative through the recursion that `fad`
carries. No carry is declared there. A carry in the forward loop would
be stored at `n-1` and read at `n` -- the adjoint recurrence run
forward in time, which is neither gradient; that is what the sweep did
before `bra_sweep_is_causal` gated the carries. Block-exact reverse
gradients that feed back into the graph would need the update to wait
for the end of the block: that is the host-driven pattern of
[docs/rad-usage-en.md](rad-usage-en.md), or a future explicit-horizon
mode.

A recursion inside the body or a seed that is read only through a delay
(`ba.time`, a `mem` counter, a `pstate` gate) is scheduled at its first
delayed read (`schedule_unreachable_recursion_group`): the scheduled
previsit does not enter a carrier, and a program with reverse-time
outputs has no previsit at all, so nothing else would lower its body
pass.

The plan still reserves `rad(expr, seeds, horizon)` and `-rad-horizon N`
for a future explicit-horizon mode; current BRA semantics use the
current compute block as the finite horizon. RAD must never silently
emit a misleading gradient.

Phase E0 added a read-only classifier in
`crates/propagate/src/stateful_rad.rs` for `DEBRUIJNREC` groups. It
classifies recursive bodies as `LinearLti`, `LinearTimeVarying`, or
`Nonlinear`. This classifier now annotates fallback mode and future
strategy selection; it no longer selects a public `ReverseTimeRec`
fast path.

The same module also exposes `RecRadMode`, a strategy gate for the
next phases:

| Recursive class | Future RAD mode |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `LinearLti` | `LinearTranspose` (dormant specialized phase E1 path) |
| `LinearTimeVarying` | `BlockLinearTimeVarying` (phase E2) |
| `Nonlinear` | `BpttRequired` (phase F) |

The `ReverseTimeRec` LTI/IIR path remains in the codebase as dormant
helper infrastructure, but public RAD propagation no longer emits it.
Temporal and recursive public RAD outputs use `BlockReverseAD`; the
mode labels are retained to classify what more specialized strategy
could replace BRA later.

The diagnostic kinds are:

| `kind` | Family |
|--------|--------|
| `delay-or-prefix` | `Delay1`, `Delay`, `Prefix` |
| `recursive-linear-transpose` | LTI recursive class for the dormant E1 path |
| `recursive-block-linear-time-varying` | `Proj` over LTV `DEBRUIJNREC` (future E2) |
| `recursive-bptt-required` | `Proj` over nonlinear `DEBRUIJNREC` (future F) |
| `recursive-projection` | recursive fallback when no specific mode was classified |
| `writable-table` / `writable-table-or-waveform-direct` | mutable tables |
| `ffun` | non-unary or unrecognised foreign function |
| `soundfile` | `Soundfile`, `SoundfileLength`, `SoundfileRate`, `SoundfileBuffer` |
| `other` | catch-all (representation casts, generators, opaque) |
| clock-domain kinds | `ondemand`, `upsampling`, `downsampling`, `Seq`, `ZeroPad` and clock-env tokens; crossing a boundary is rejected until a clock-aware reverse tape exists. A `rad` whose expression and seeds live inside one `ondemand` body is supported: its inputs are leaves and the clocked wrapper is passed through |

Temporal/recursive kinds are normally caught by the public dispatcher
and converted to `BlockReverseAD`. If one of those diagnostics surfaces
directly, it indicates a fallback-dispatch regression. Hard unsupported
kinds still emit structured diagnostics with kind-specific notes and
help text.

## 5. Relationship to FAD

The explicit symbolic rules of both passes overlap for feed-forward
expressions, but their unsupported-family policies differ: FAD generally
preserves the primal with zero tangents, while RAD rejects hard unsupported
families rather than emitting an unverified gradient.

| Property | FAD | RAD (current) |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Direction | tangent ↑ (per seed) | adjoint ↓ (per primal) |
| Seed model | explicit `(s_0, …, s_{N-1})` | explicit `(s_0, …, s_{N-1})` |
| Output layout | `[p, t_0, …, t_{N-1}]` interleaved per primal | `[primals…, gradient(s_0), …]` flat |
| Cost per added seed | one extra tangent lane per primal node | one gradient extraction lane; the reverse sweep is shared |
| Cost per added primal | one extra dual rebuild | one extra adjoint initialization; active-subgraph traversal remains shared |
| Recursive primals | yes (via `DEBRUIJNREC` interleaving) | yes, via block-local `BlockReverseAD` fallback |
| Delays | yes (causal forward rule) | yes, via block-local `BlockReverseAD` fallback |
| Clock domains | dual rules for valid clocked blocks; runtime tests cover inside/around `ondemand`; clock is opaque | crossing clock-domain machinery is rejected |
| Multi-output cotangent | implicit per-tangent | implicit all-ones (sum cotangent) |

For feed-forward expressions, RAD gradients agree with the
corresponding FAD tangent lanes lane-by-lane (scalar primal) or with
the **sum** of FAD tangent lanes across primals (multi-output, due to
the implicit all-ones cotangent). This identity is pinned by the
parity tests in `crates/compiler/tests/rad_runtime.rs`.

## 6. Test surface

- **Structural** ([crates/propagate/tests/core_api.rs](../crates/propagate/tests/core_api.rs))
  — arity contract, feed-forward success, temporal/recursive
  `BlockReverseAD` fallback, diagnostic content checks for hard
  unsupported families and internal kind labels.
- **Runtime parity** ([crates/compiler/tests/rad_runtime.rs](../crates/compiler/tests/rad_runtime.rs))
  — RAD vs FAD parity, RAD vs central finite differences, repeated /
  absent seeds, multi-output sum cotangent, read-only table index,
  supported unary FFun families (`tanh`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `atanh`,
  `asinh`, `acosh`), and recursive BRA cases: the block gradient of an
  interior recursive output, of a `select2` in a recursive body and of a
  gradient-only public output against finite differences, a computed
  seed as a leaf, the one-sample horizon of the in-graph sweep
  (`in_graph_rad_*`: direct term vs `fad`, no carry declared), and
  recursions read only through a delay inside a carrier or next to a
  public gradient, the unary foreign functions in a temporal body
  (lane by lane against `fad`; a two-tap FIR followed by `tanh` learned
  in the graph), and the block gradient of a two-pole recursion against
  finite differences.
- **DDSP examples** ([crates/compiler/tests/ddsp_examples.rs](../crates/compiler/tests/ddsp_examples.rs))
  -- the six programs of [libraries/ddsp-examples-en.md](../libraries/ddsp-examples-en.md);
  the host-driven one checks the block gradient of `fi.tf2` against
  finite differences, then trains the sliders with Adam from Rust.
- **Backend parity** ([crates/compiler/tests/signal_fir_lane.rs](../crates/compiler/tests/signal_fir_lane.rs))
  — C, C++, interpreter, and Cranelift lowering of RAD/BRA shapes within the
  current fast-lane subset.
- **Corpus** ([tests/corpus/rad_*.dsp](../tests/corpus)) — fixtures
  pin the source-level shape of each contract: arithmetic, trig
  composition, multi-seed, multi-output, repeated/absent seeds,
  read-only table indexing, accepted recursive/block RAD forms,
  plus arity error fixtures (`err_rad_zero_body`, `err_rad_zero_seed`) and
  the temporal fallback fixture `rad_delay1_block_fallback`; the two
  examples of Rushton's AES 2025 paper, the neuron and the IIR with the
  paper's own routing (`rad_neuron_sigmoid`, `rad_iir_transposed`, with
  their `fad_` twins), checked in
  [crates/compiler/tests/aes_autodiff_paper.rs](../crates/compiler/tests/aes_autodiff_paper.rs)
  against the closed form, finite differences, `fad` and `fi.iir`.

## 7. Out-of-scope and future work

The following remain explicitly out of scope for current RAD:

- specialized `ReverseTimeRec` / phase-E recursive fast paths in public RAD
  dispatch,
- explicit user-controlled horizons (`rad(expr, seeds, horizon)` /
  `-rad-horizon N`),
- adjoints over mutable tables,
- adjoints over soundfile content,
- custom vector-output cotangent API (`vjp(...)`),
- backend-level Enzyme/LLVM integration,
- automatic discovery of differentiable UI controls.
- reverse mode across `ondemand` / `upsampling` / `downsampling` boundaries.

Plan phases E and F sketch the next steps:

- **Phase E0** — implemented read-only recursive-linearity classifier
  and `RecRadMode` strategy gate; no new `rad(...)` capability.
- **Phase E1/E2** — scoped specialized recursive strategies that can replace
  generic BRA where profitable and proven equivalent.
- **Phase F** — a finite-horizon BPTT mode (`rad(expr, seeds, horizon)`
  or `-rad-horizon N`) requiring a runtime tape and a backend backward
  sweep.

These phases are gated separately and require explicit documentation
of latency and memory footprints before merge.
