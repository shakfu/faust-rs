# Forward-Mode AD over de Bruijn Recursive Signals

Synthesis note describing how the forward-mode automatic differentiation
(FAD) pass implemented in `crates/propagate/src/forward_ad.rs` handles
recursive signal groups expressed in de Bruijn form, with particular focus
on `transform_uncached`, `match_de_bruijn_rec`, and the `SigMatch::Proj`
arm.

## 1. Background

In the `propagate` phase, every recursive signal group is materialized in
**de Bruijn form**, i.e. as the pair of tag nodes:

- `DEBRUIJNREC(body)` — a binder introducing a recursive scope whose body is
  a cons-list of element signals;
- `DEBRUIJNREF(level)` — an integer reference to the `level`-th enclosing
  `DEBRUIJNREC` (innermost = `1`).

Individual outputs of a group are accessed through projection nodes
`Proj(index, group)`, where `group` is either a `DEBRUIJNREC` directly or a
`DEBRUIJNREF` resolving to one. Symbolic-form recursions (`SYMREC` /
`SYMREF`) are introduced only later, by `de_bruijn_to_sym` in
`signal_prepare`, and are therefore never observed by FAD.

## 2. Internal representation of differentiated signals

FAD operates on a dual carrier:

```text
Dual { primal: SigId, tangents: [SigId; N] }
```

where `N` is the number of seed lanes (the seeds passed to
`fad(expr, seeds)`). For a recursion of arity `k`, FAD must produce a
single rebuilt group whose body has arity `k · (1 + N)`, interleaving each
slot's primal with its `N` tangent lanes:

```text
[ p0, t0_s0, …, t0_s{N-1},
  p1, t1_s0, …, t1_s{N-1},
  … ]
```

This interleaving is the contract that `Proj` will rely on when selecting a
specific lane out of the group.

## 3. Three kinds of indices

The recursion handling rests on three distinct numeric notions which the
implementation keeps separate:

| Notion              | Carrier                               | Meaning                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level**           | payload of `DEBRUIJNREF(level)`       | Static integer naming the `k`-th enclosing `DEBRUIJNREC` (innermost = 1) |
| **`debruijn_depth`**| dynamic counter on `ForwardADTransform` | Number of `DEBRUIJNREC` scopes the *current* descent has itself rewritten |
| **Slot**            | `index` payload of `Proj(index, …)`   | Position of an output element inside a recursion body                   |

The level is a property of the source term; `debruijn_depth` is a property
of the rewriter's traversal; the slot is a property of the projection. FAD
correctness depends on relating them correctly when a `Proj` reaches the
arm responsible for it.

## 4. Entry into a `DEBRUIJNREC` body — `transform_uncached`

When `transform_uncached` is called on a signal `sig`, it consults the
arena via `match_de_bruijn_rec(arena, sig)`. If that returns `Some(body)`,
the following sequence is executed (forward_ad.rs, lines 560–615):

1. **Cycle-breaking placeholder.** Insert a self-referential `Dual` for
   `sig` into the cache *before* descending. Any `DEBRUIJNREF(1)`
   encountered in the body is then resolved through `match_de_bruijn_ref`
   into a fresh `Dual` whose primal and every tangent point back at the
   original (un-rewritten) group. Because this entry is overwritten with
   the rebuilt interleaved group on return, the placeholder is never
   observed externally — its only role is to make the back-edge resolvable
   while slots are being interned.

2. **Increment `debruijn_depth`** by `+1` to reflect that the rewriter has
   now entered one more recursive scope on this descent path.

3. **Lift active seeds.** Crossing a `DEBRUIJNREC` binder shifts every free
   `DEBRUIJNREF` in the surrounding term by one level. To keep `SigId`
   equality in seed recognition meaningful inside the body, every seed is
   transformed through `lift_de_bruijn(arena, seed)` and the reverse index
   is rebuilt. The previous `(diff_seeds, diff_seed_index)` is stashed and
   restored on exit.

4. **Differentiate the body.** `transform_list(body)` walks each element of
   the cons-list and produces a `Vec<Dual>` of the same length `k`.

5. **Restore state.** Pop the seed snapshot and decrement
   `debruijn_depth`.

6. **Interleave and re-intern.** For every element dual `(p_i, t_i_*)`,
   push `p_i` followed by every tangent lane `t_i_s0, …, t_i_s{N-1}` into a
   single linear vector of length `k · (1 + N)`. Wrap that as a cons-list
   `list_node` and feed it to `de_bruijn_rec` to obtain the rebuilt group
   `fad_rec`.

7. **Return.** The returned `Dual` has primal `fad_rec` and *all* tangent
   lanes equal to `fad_rec`. At the group level there is no meaningful
   primal/tangent split: differentiation is realised only when a `Proj`
   selects a specific slot inside the interleaved body.

`match_de_bruijn_ref` is also consulted at the top of
`transform_uncached`: a bare `DEBRUIJNREF(level)` carries no slot of its
own, so it is forwarded as primal with all tangent lanes pointing to the
same reference. The interpretation of that reference is deferred to the
enclosing `Proj`.

## 5. Projection — `SigMatch::Proj`

The `Proj(index, group)` arm (forward_ad.rs, lines 971–1031) is where the
three kinds of indices are reconciled. Let `N` be the seed count and let
`L = 1 + N` (the per-slot **lane count**, exposed by `bundle_lane_count`).

The arm first classifies the `group` operand into three cases via a local
`GroupKind` enum:

| `GroupKind`      | Test                                                        | Intuition                                                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BoundRec`       | `match_de_bruijn_rec(arena, group)` is `Some`, **or** `match_de_bruijn_ref(arena, group)` returns a level `≤ debruijn_depth` | The targeted recursion has been rebuilt by *this* transformer on the current descent path. Its body uses the interleaved `1 + N` layout. |
| `UnboundRef`     | `match_de_bruijn_ref(arena, group)` returns a level `> debruijn_depth` | The reference points at an outer recursion that this transformer has not entered on the current path. Its body still uses the original slot numbering. |
| `Other`          | Neither of the above                                        | Defensive fallback for non-de-Bruijn shapes.                                               |

Each case rewrites the projection differently:

- **`BoundRec`.** The slot arithmetic uses the interleaved layout:
  ```text
  primal  = Proj(index · L,           dual_group.primal)
  t_s_j   = Proj(index · L + 1 + j,   dual_group.tangents[j])     for j ∈ 0..N
  ```
  Note that because every tangent of `dual_group` aliases `fad_rec`,
  `dual_group.tangents[j]` is the same node as `dual_group.primal`; the
  distinction matters only for keeping the type uniform.

- **`UnboundRef`.** The targeted group has not been re-interleaved; its
  slot numbering is the original one. The primal is therefore forwarded
  unchanged and *every* tangent lane is forced to the constant `0.0`:
  ```text
  primal  = Proj(index, dual_group.primal)
  t_s_j   = 0.0                                                   for j ∈ 0..N
  ```
  This is the subtle case: the rewriter is differentiating inside an inner
  recursion, but the projection points at an enclosing recursion whose
  body has not been rebuilt by this descent. No `(1 + N)` expansion is
  available in that enclosing body, so propagating tangents through it
  would be ill-typed against the un-rewritten slot layout. Forcing the
  tangent to zero is consistent: from the inner recursion's local
  viewpoint, the outer slot is treated as an external constant on the
  current path.

- **`Other`.** The projection is propagated lane-wise:
  ```text
  primal  = Proj(index, dual_group.primal)
  t_s_j   = Proj(index, dual_group.tangents[j])                   for j ∈ 0..N
  ```
  This branch only fires for shapes outside the expected de-Bruijn-only
  flow and is kept for robustness rather than for any first-class semantic
  case.

## 6. Rewriting rules — formalisation

We summarize the rewriter as a system of structural rules. Let:

- `T[·]` denote the transformation `transform`, returning a pair
  `⟨ p ; t_0, …, t_{N-1} ⟩`;
- `d` denote the current `debruijn_depth`;
- `↑σ` denote `lift_de_bruijn` applied to seed term `σ`;
- `seeds = (σ_0, …, σ_{N-1})` denote the current seed vector;
- `L = 1 + N`.

### 6.1 Seed recognition (highest priority)

```
                 sig ≡ σ_j       (for some j ∈ 0..N)
   (Seed)  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
           T_seeds, d ⊢ sig  ⟹  ⟨ sig ; e_j ⟩
```
where `e_j` is the unit lane vector `(0,…,0,1,0,…,0)` (real `1.0` on lane
`j`, real `0.0` elsewhere). Repeated seeds set every matching lane to
`1.0`.

### 6.2 Free de Bruijn reference

```
   (Ref)   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
           T_seeds, d ⊢ DEBRUIJNREF(ℓ)  ⟹  ⟨ ref ; ref, …, ref ⟩
```

The reference is preserved primally; tangent slots alias the same node and
are reinterpreted by the enclosing `Proj`.

### 6.3 Recursive binder

```
                      seeds' = (↑σ_0, …, ↑σ_{N-1})
                T_seeds', d+1 ⊢ b_i  ⟹  ⟨ p_i ; t_i_0, …, t_i_{N-1} ⟩    for i ∈ 0..k
                body' = [ p_0, t_0_0, …, t_0_{N-1},  p_1, t_1_0, …, t_{k-1}_{N-1} ]
                R = DEBRUIJNREC(body')
   (Rec)  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           T_seeds, d ⊢ DEBRUIJNREC([b_0, …, b_{k-1}])  ⟹  ⟨ R ; R, …, R ⟩
```

Two side conditions implement the cycle-breaking and seed-lifting logic
described in §4:

1. Before the body premises are evaluated, the cache is augmented with
   `DEBRUIJNREC(b_*) ↦ ⟨ DEBRUIJNREC(b_*) ; DEBRUIJNREC(b_*), … ⟩` so that
   any back-edge `DEBRUIJNREF(1)` introduced while differentiating the
   body resolves consistently. This binding is overwritten by the rule's
   conclusion before returning to the parent.
2. The `seeds'` and depth `d+1` apply only inside the premises; the
   conclusion restores the outer `seeds` and `d`.

### 6.4 Projection

The arm distinguishes three cases. Let `T_seeds, d ⊢ G ⟹ ⟨ pG ; tG_0, …, tG_{N-1} ⟩`.

**Bound recursion.** `G` is `DEBRUIJNREC(_)`, or `G` is `DEBRUIJNREF(ℓ)`
with `ℓ ≤ d`:

```
   (Proj-Bound)  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 T_seeds, d ⊢ Proj(i, G)  ⟹
                    ⟨ Proj(i·L, pG)  ;
                      Proj(i·L + 1, tG_0), …, Proj(i·L + N, tG_{N-1}) ⟩
```

**Unbound reference.** `G` is `DEBRUIJNREF(ℓ)` with `ℓ > d`:

```
   (Proj-Unbound) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  T_seeds, d ⊢ Proj(i, G)  ⟹  ⟨ Proj(i, pG) ;  0.0, …, 0.0 ⟩
```

**Defensive fallback.** Any other shape:

```
   (Proj-Other)  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 T_seeds, d ⊢ Proj(i, G)  ⟹
                    ⟨ Proj(i, pG)  ;  Proj(i, tG_0), …, Proj(i, tG_{N-1}) ⟩
```

### 6.5 DAG sharing

The transform is memoized: every `SigId` rewritten by `T` is cached in
`ForwardADTransform::cache`. The `(Rec)` rule's pre-insertion of a
placeholder makes the cache act simultaneously as a cycle-breaker for the
back-edges introduced by `DEBRUIJNREF(1)` inside the recursion body.

## 7. Worked example — single feedback loop

Take the single-seed program:

```text
process = fad((2 : + ~ *(p)), p);
```

After lowering, the propagation phase represents the feedback loop as:

```text
R = DEBRUIJNREC([ + ( 2 , * ( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) , p ) ) ])
y = Proj(0, R)
```

`Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1))` is the back-edge: it selects slot 0 from the
single-element group of the previous iteration. With `N = 1` lane (seed
`p`) and `L = 1 + N = 2`, the rewriter proceeds as follows.

**Step 1 — enter `R` via `(Rec)`.**
Pre-install the self-referential placeholder `R ↦ ⟨R; R⟩` in the cache.
Set `debruijn_depth = 1`. Lift the seed: `p` carries no `DEBRUIJNREF`, so
the lifted seed is still `p`.

**Step 2 — differentiate the body element.**

```text
+ ( 2 , * ( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) , p ) )
```

*Sub-term `DEBRUIJNREF(1)`:* rule `(Ref)` applies — the reference is
preserved and every tangent lane aliases the primal:

```
T ⊢ DEBRUIJNREF(1)  ⟹  ⟨ ref ; ref ⟩
```

*Sub-term `Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1))`:* rule `(Proj-Bound)` applies because
`level = 1 ≤ debruijn_depth = 1`:

```
primal  = Proj(0 · 2,     ref) = Proj(0, ref)
tangent = Proj(0 · 2 + 1, ref) = Proj(1, ref)
```

`Proj(0, ref)` selects the primal slot and `Proj(1, ref)` selects the
tangent slot of the back-edge — these both resolve to `DEBRUIJNREF(1)` in
the rebuilt group `R'`.

*Product `*(Proj(0, ref), p)`:* product rule `(x·y)' = x'·y + x·y'`:

```
primal  = Proj(0, ref) · p
tangent = Proj(1, ref) · p  +  Proj(0, ref) · 1.0
```

*Addition `+(2, ·)`:* constant `2` contributes `0` to the tangent:

```
primal  = 2 + Proj(0, ref) · p
tangent = Proj(1, ref) · p  +  Proj(0, ref)
```

**Step 3 — restore state and interleave.**

Restore the outer seed snapshot and decrement `debruijn_depth`. Interleave
`[primal, tangent]` per slot to build the expanded body, then call
`de_bruijn_rec`:

```text
R' = DEBRUIJNREC([
  + ( 2 , * ( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) , p ) ) ,           -- slot 0 : primal
  + ( * ( Proj(1, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) , p ) , Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) )  -- slot 1 : tangent
])
```

Inside `R'`, `DEBRUIJNREF(1)` now refers back to `R'` itself:
`Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1))` is `y[n-1]` and `Proj(1, DEBRUIJNREF(1))` is
`dy/dp[n-1]`.

**Step 4 — output projections** via `(Proj-Bound)` with `i=0, L=2`:

```
y      = Proj(0 · 2,     R') = Proj(0, R')
dy/dp  = Proj(0 · 2 + 1, R') = Proj(1, R')
```

The emitted recursion is the joint system:

```text
y[n]      = 2 + p · y[n-1]
dy/dp[n]  = p · dy/dp[n-1]  +  y[n-1]
```

Both outputs share one interleaved `DEBRUIJNREC` instead of duplicated
primal shadows.

## 8. Worked example — nested feedback loops

The single-loop example only exercises `DEBRUIJNREF(1)`. The following DSP
program produces a genuinely nested `DEBRUIJNREC` with a back-edge at level 2,
covering both the `(Proj-Bound)` and `(Proj-Unbound)` rules.

### 8.1 The Faust program

```faust
// Damped-feedback resonator
//   y[n] = x[n] + z[n]
//   z[n] = y[n−1]  +  damp · z[n−1]
//
// z accumulates past values of y while leaking at rate damp.
// Together the pair forms a second-order IIR whose two state
// variables share one feedback path.

damp = hslider("damp", 0.9, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01);
process = _ : + ~ (+ ~ *(damp));
```

The `~` nesting is the key:

- **Outer `~`**: `y[n] = x[n] + <feedback>(y[n−1])` where `<feedback> = + ~ *(damp)`.
- **Inner `~`**: `z[n] = y[n−1] + damp · z[n−1]`.

`y[n−1]` is the outer loop's own back-edge value; it appears as an input
to the inner loop, making the inner body reference it via a de Bruijn
level-2 pointer.

### 8.2 De Bruijn signal graph

After propagation, the two feedback loops materialise as two nested
`DEBRUIJNREC` nodes:

```text
OUTER = DEBRUIJNREC([
  +( x ,  Proj(0, INNER) )                         -- y[n]
])

INNER = DEBRUIJNREC([
  +( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2)) ,                     -- y[n−1] : level 2 → OUTER
     *( damp ,  Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) ) )        -- z[n−1] : level 1 → INNER itself
])

output = Proj(0, OUTER)
```

`DEBRUIJNREF(level)` counts enclosing binders inward-out, innermost = 1:

| Reference | Level | Resolves to | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `DEBRUIJNREF(1)` inside INNER | 1 | INNER | `z[n−1]` — inner's own previous output |
| `DEBRUIJNREF(2)` inside INNER | 2 | OUTER | `y[n−1]` — outer's previous output |

### 8.3 FAD trace — seed `damp`, N = 1, L = 2

```faust
process = _ : fad(+ ~ (+ ~ *(damp)), damp);
```

**Enter OUTER (depth 0 → 1).** Placeholder `OUTER ↦ ⟨OUTER; OUTER⟩`. Seed
`damp` carries no `DEBRUIJNREF`, so it lifts unchanged.

**Inside OUTER body, enter INNER (depth 1 → 2).** Placeholder
`INNER ↦ ⟨INNER; INNER⟩`. Seed lifted again (still `damp`).

**Differentiate the INNER body element:**

```text
+( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2)) ,  *( damp ,  Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) ) )
```

*`Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2))` — level 2, depth 2:*

```
level 2  ≤  debruijn_depth 2   →   (Proj-Bound)

  primal  = Proj(0 · 2 + 0, fad_outer) = Proj(0, fad_outer)   ← y[n−1]
  tangent = Proj(0 · 2 + 1, fad_outer) = Proj(1, fad_outer)   ← dy/d(damp)[n−1]
```

*`Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1))` — level 1, depth 2:*

```
level 1  ≤  debruijn_depth 2   →   (Proj-Bound)

  primal  = Proj(0, fad_inner)    ← z[n−1]
  tangent = Proj(1, fad_inner)    ← dz/d(damp)[n−1]
```

*`damp` — seed match:* `(Seed)` → primal = `damp`, tangent = `1.0`.

*Product `*(damp, Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)))`:*

```
primal  = damp · Proj(0, fad_inner)
tangent = Proj(0, fad_inner)  +  damp · Proj(1, fad_inner)
```

*Addition:*

```
primal  = Proj(0, fad_outer)  +  damp · Proj(0, fad_inner)
tangent = Proj(1, fad_outer)  +  Proj(0, fad_inner)  +  damp · Proj(1, fad_inner)
```

**Rebuild INNER (interleaved, 2 slots):**

```text
fad_inner = DEBRUIJNREC([
  slot 0 :  +( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2)) ,  *( damp , Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) ) )
  slot 1 :  +( Proj(1, DEBRUIJNREF(2)) ,
               +( Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) ,  *( damp , Proj(1, DEBRUIJNREF(1)) ) ) )
])
```

`DEBRUIJNREF(1)` → `fad_inner` (slots 0/1 = z-primal/z-tangent);
`DEBRUIJNREF(2)` → `fad_outer` (slots 0/1 = y-primal/y-tangent).

**Rebuild OUTER (interleaved, 2 slots):**

```text
fad_outer = DEBRUIJNREC([
  slot 0 :  +( x ,  Proj(0, fad_inner) )     -- y[n]
  slot 1 :  +( 0 ,  Proj(1, fad_inner) )     -- dy/d(damp)[n]
])
```

**Output projections:**

```
y           = Proj(0, fad_outer)
dy/d(damp)  = Proj(1, fad_outer)
```

**Resulting joint system:**

```text
y[n]           = x[n] + z[n]
z[n]           = y[n−1] + damp · z[n−1]

dy/d(damp)[n]  = dz/d(damp)[n]
dz/d(damp)[n]  = dy/d(damp)[n−1]  +  z[n−1]  +  damp · dz/d(damp)[n−1]
```

Both the primal pair `(y, z)` and the tangent pair share one interleaved
`fad_outer / fad_inner` recursion with no separate primal shadow.

### 8.4 When `(Proj-Unbound)` fires

Both back-edges above used `(Proj-Bound)` because FAD entered OUTER before
INNER — `debruijn_depth` reached 2 before any `DEBRUIJNREF(2)` was inspected.

`(Proj-Unbound)` fires when INNER is processed at a shallower depth than
its `DEBRUIJNREF` levels require. Consider a signal graph where INNER —
still carrying `DEBRUIJNREF(2)` in its body — is also reachable via a path
that does not pass through OUTER:

```text
output_1 = Proj(0, INNER)    ← accessed directly, outside OUTER's scope
output_2 = Proj(0, OUTER)    ← normal nested access
```

When FAD processes `output_1`:

- Enters INNER with `debruijn_depth = 1`.
- Encounters `Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2))`: level 2 > depth 1 → **(Proj-Unbound)**.
  - primal: `Proj(0, DEBRUIJNREF(2))` — slot unchanged.
  - tangent: **0.0** on every lane — OUTER has not been rebuilt on this path,
    so no interleaved tangent slot exists.
- Caches `INNER ↦ ⟨fad_inner_shallow; …⟩` (zero tangent for `y[n−1]`).

When FAD later processes `output_2` via OUTER:

- Enters OUTER (`depth = 1`), encounters INNER in the body.
- **Cache hit** → returns `fad_inner_shallow`, computed at depth 1.
- The tangent contribution through `y[n−1]` is **silently zero** even
  though OUTER is now in scope and its tangent slot exists.

This is the "price paid": INNER's derivative w.r.t. `damp` through
`y[n−1]` is dropped. The shortcut is sound only if OUTER's outputs are
independent of the active seeds at the point where INNER is evaluated
without OUTER's context.

In a well-formed Faust program produced by the standard compiler front-end,
a `DEBRUIJNREC` node carrying free `DEBRUIJNREF(k > 1)` cannot appear
outside the scope of its `k−1` enclosing binders. The `(Proj-Unbound)`
branch is therefore a defensive boundary — it applies to malformed or
compiler-internal intermediate graphs, not to programs written directly in
Faust.

## 9. Invariants

The rules above preserve the following invariants:

- **Layout invariant.** A rebuilt recursion of original arity `k` has
  arity `k · L` with the interleaving `[p_0, t_0_*, p_1, t_1_*, …]`. Every
  `Proj` arm produced by `(Proj-Bound)` respects that layout.

- **Depth invariant.** `debruijn_depth` strictly counts the
  `DEBRUIJNREC` scopes rewritten on the current path; it is always
  matched by a corresponding decrement on body completion (`(Rec)`).

- **Seed-lifting invariant.** Inside the body of `(Rec)`, the active seed
  set is exactly the lifted snapshot, which keeps `SigId` equality the
  correct seed-recognition test even after a binder has been crossed.

- **Cycle-safety invariant.** The placeholder inserted by `(Rec)` before
  body evaluation is overwritten before returning, so no externally
  observable result projects from the placeholder; back-edges resolved
  through it are always re-projected against the rebuilt interleaved
  group through the `(Proj-Bound)` rule.

- **Soundness boundary at unbound references.** `(Proj-Unbound)` is the
  only place where a tangent is forced to zero for structural rather than
  mathematical reasons. It triggers exactly when an inner recursion
  references an outer recursion whose body has not been re-interleaved on
  the current path (see §8.4 for a concrete illustration), and is the
  price paid for not eagerly rewriting enclosing recursions on every
  descent into an inner one.
