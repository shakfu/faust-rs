# Forward Automatic Differentiation in `faust-rs`

## Executive Summary

`faust-rs` now exposes a native forward automatic differentiation primitive,
`fad(expr, seed)`, inside the compiler pipeline. This turns differentiation
into a compile-time symbolic transform rather than a dynamic runtime graph.

The practical result is that a Faust DSP program can emit both its primal
signals and compiler-generated local derivatives with respect to explicit seed
signals, while keeping the normal static Faust compilation model:

- parsing and evaluation stay symbolic,
- propagation builds a differentiated signal graph,
- FIR lowering and backends emit ordinary DSP code,
- recursion is handled without requiring an external ML runtime.

The rules are exact symbolic chain rules for the explicitly modeled signal
families. Read-only table indices use a documented finite-difference slope, and
unsupported families preserve the primal with zero tangents; those boundaries
must not be confused with exact mathematical derivatives.

This is a forward-mode differentiable extension of the Faust signal language,
implemented directly in the Rust compiler. It is a `faust-rs` extension: the
current C++ Faust reference used by this project does not recognize `fad`.

## 1. Overview

`faust-rs` now exposes a forward-mode automatic differentiation primitive,
`fad(expr, seed)`, inside the Faust language accepted by the Rust compiler. It
lets a DSP author ask for the value of an expression and its derivative with
respect to one or more explicit seed signals, without manually rewriting the
signal graph into dual form.

At a high level:

- `expr` is the DSP expression to differentiate.
- `seed` selects the variable or variables with respect to which the derivative
  is taken.
- each output of `expr` is followed by one tangent output per seed lane.

The primitive is deliberately explicit. `faust-rs` does not implicitly
differentiate with respect to "all controls in scope"; instead, the seed
expression determines the differentiation variables. This makes the primitive
predictable, composable, and much easier to reason about in recursive code.

At Signal IR level, a seed is recognized by `SigId` identity after lowering and
hash-consing. A seed may be a control, input, recursive value, or expression,
but it must be the same lowered signal that occurs in the differentiated body;
`fad` does not solve for an arbitrary algebraically equivalent expression.
Repeated seed lanes are preserved rather than deduplicated.

This note focuses on **forward AD**. Reverse AD (`rad`) is also available in the
compiler, with different output and temporal semantics; see
[rad-usage-en.md](rad-usage-en.md) and [rad-note-en.md](rad-note-en.md).

This note summarizes:

1. the surface semantics of `fad(expr, seed)`,
2. the compiler pipeline used to implement it,
3. the recursion model and why it matters,
4. the supported boundaries of the feature,
5. practical DSP usage patterns with examples.

## 2. Surface Semantics

### 2.1 Basic rule

If `expr` lowers to `M` outputs `p_0 ... p_(M-1)` and `seed` lowers to `N`
signals `s_0 ... s_(N-1)`, the output contract is:

```text
fad(expr, seed) =
  [p_0, dp_0/ds_0, ..., dp_0/ds_(N-1),
   p_1, dp_1/ds_0, ..., dp_1/ds_(N-1),
   ...]
```

The output arity is therefore `M * (1 + N)`. With no seed outputs,
`fad(expr, ())` is an identity on the primal outputs.

If `seed` is a single signal, `fad` produces two outputs:

- primal,
- tangent.

If `seed` is a tuple-like parallel expression, `fad` produces one tangent per
seed lane. For example:

```faust
x = hslider("x", 1, -10, 10, 0.01);
y = hslider("y", 1, -10, 10, 0.01);
process = fad(x * y, (x, y));
```

returns three outputs:

1. `x * y`
2. `d(x*y)/dx = y`
3. `d(x*y)/dy = x`

### 2.2 Tangent extraction

Because `fad` returns the primal first, a common pattern is to select only the
derivative lane:

```faust
grad = fad(loss, param) : !, _;
```

This keeps the tangent and discards the primal. In the current output ordering,
`!, _` is the standard "tangent-only" projection for a single-seed `fad`.

### 2.3 Multi-seed behavior

Multi-seed `fad` is observable in output order:

```faust
f = hslider("freq", 1000, 50, 4000, 1);
q = hslider("q", 1.0, 0.1, 10.0, 0.01);
x = no.noise;

process = fad(x : fi.resonlp(f, q, 1.0), (f, q));
```

This produces:

1. the filter output,
2. the derivative with respect to `f`,
3. the derivative with respect to `q`.

The implementation preserves this ordering throughout propagation and code
generation.

## 3. Why `fad` Matters in DSP

Forward AD is useful whenever a DSP patch needs local sensitivity information.
Typical examples are:

- gradient monitoring for adaptive algorithms,
- parameter estimation,
- in-graph optimization and adaptive updates,
- differentiable control analysis,
- recursive adaptive updates where the gradient of a loss depends on the
  previous state.

In a Faust setting, `fad` is attractive because it operates directly on the
signal graph. A user does not need to manually define derivative versions of
`sin`, `pow`, `delay`, or recursive projections; the compiler applies the chain
rule structurally.

This makes small differentiable DSP programs much easier to write and maintain
than hand-written dual graphs.

## 4. How `fad` Is Implemented

The implementation follows the normal `faust-rs` pipeline:

```text
parse -> boxes -> eval -> propagate -> normalize -> transform -> fir -> backend
```

### 4.1 Parser and box layer

At parse time, `fad(expr, seed)` is recognized as a dedicated box node. The
relevant surface is in:

- [crates/boxes/src/builder.rs](../crates/boxes/src/builder.rs)
- [crates/boxes/src/matcher.rs](../crates/boxes/src/matcher.rs)

The parser builds a `ForwardAD(expr, seed)` box wrapper rather than expanding
the derivative immediately. That is important because the rest of the compiler
still needs to flatten modules, substitutions, metadata, and recursive aliases
before signal-level differentiation is safe.

### 4.2 Evaluation

The evaluator preserves the `ForwardAD` wrapper instead of trying to interpret
it as an ordinary computation. This keeps `fad` visible until signal
propagation.

The same area also contains the recursion alias preservation work that made
patterns such as:

```faust
state = next ~ _;
prev  = state;
next  = saturate(prev + input);
```

semantically usable inside `faust-rs`. In this document, the safe claim is:

- this pattern has a clear causal DSP meaning,
- `faust-rs` supports it through targeted recursive-alias preservation,
- it should not be presented as a blanket claim about every Faust compiler or
  every equivalent source form.

That matters because many useful AD examples refer to the previous recursive
state by name.

### 4.3 Propagation and signal differentiation

The actual AD transform lives in:

- [crates/propagate/src/forward_ad.rs](../crates/propagate/src/forward_ad.rs)
- [crates/propagate/src/lib.rs](../crates/propagate/src/lib.rs)

This is the key stage. Once the box graph has been lowered to signals,
`generate_fad_signals_multi(...)` creates one `ForwardADTransform` for the
complete seed set, traverses the signal DAG, and produces a dual bundle for
each primal signal:

```text
[primal, tangent_0, tangent_1, ... tangent_n]
```

for every visited node.

The transform is memoized. Shared sub-expressions are traversed once and reused.
The resulting graph scales with the source DAG and the number of tangent lanes,
although individual derivative rules can introduce additional algebraic nodes.

### 4.4 Multi-lane dual representation

Earlier prototypes effectively ran one differentiator per seed. The current
model carries all tangents together in one bundle:

```text
Dual {
  primal,
  tangents[0..N)
}
```

That is especially important for recursive code. Instead of duplicating a
recursive shadow for each seed, the transform now builds one interleaved
recursive carrier containing:

```text
[primal, d/ds0, d/ds1, ...]
```

This reduces redundant state, improves generated code, and keeps tangent order
stable.

### 4.5 FIR and backend code generation

After propagation, `fad` no longer exists as a source primitive. It has become
an ordinary expanded multi-output signal graph. Downstream preparation, FIR
lowering, and code generation see only extra outputs and recursive state lanes,
so the individual backends do not need their own differentiation pass.

That design is useful because it keeps AD mostly localized to the propagation
phase. The backend does not need a dedicated differentiation pass.

## 5. Recursion Support

Recursion is where AD becomes technically interesting. A purely feed-forward
transform is straightforward; recursive DSP requires careful handling of delayed
self-reference.

### 5.1 Local recursive gradients

The following pattern is supported:

```faust
pan = step ~ _ with {
  target = hslider("Target", 0, -1, 1, 0.01);
  lr = hslider("LR", 0.05, 0, 1, 0.001);

  step(prev) = prev - lr * grad with {
    loss = (prev - target) ^ 2;
    grad = fad(loss, prev) : !, _;
  };
};

process = pan;
```

This is significant because the derivative is consumed locally inside the
recursive branch. The compiler now supports that by switching from the original
"expand after recursion" model to an **augmented-state recursion** model when a
recursive branch consumes `fad` outputs immediately.

### 5.2 Validated recursive families

The implementation is strong on several recursive families:

- self-recursive state,
- nested recursion,
- mutual recursion,
- multi-output recursion,
- multi-seed recursive differentiation.

The tracked corpus and runtime tests cover these families with nested and local
seed variants. This does not make every signal family differentiable: the
boundary is set by the explicit rule table summarized below, not by recursion
alone.

## 6. Supported Signal Families

The current forward AD implementation has explicit rules for the signal
families most relevant to DSP:

- arithmetic, standard transcendentals, and the recognized unary foreign
  functions (`tanh`, `sinh`, `cosh` and their inverse hyperbolic forms),
- `pow`, `atan2`, `min/max`, `fmod`/remainder-style operations, `select2`, and
  numeric casts with a defined rule,
- unit and variable delays,
- recursive projections,
- explicit seeds with duplicates or multiple lanes,
- read-only table and waveform reads through their index,
- valid `ondemand`, `upsampling`, and `downsampling` blocks, including `fad`
  inside a block and around a block.

For clock-domain blocks, the differentiated payload is augmented once so the
primal and tangent lanes share the same firing and hold behavior. The clock is
opaque to FAD; differentiating the scheduling decision itself is not part of
the contract. Runtime tests in
[crates/compiler/tests/ondemand_pipeline.rs](../crates/compiler/tests/ondemand_pipeline.rs)
check representative gradients against analytic results or central finite
differences.

Table reads deserve a special note. `faust-rs` now differentiates read-only
`rdtable` and waveform lookups with respect to the index using a symmetric
finite-difference slope:

```text
d(table[i]) / di ~= (table[i + 1] - table[i - 1]) / 2
```

This is practical for modulation, wavetable indexing, and lookup-based models.

The main intentional "zero tangent" boundaries remain (unless the whole node
is itself matched as an explicit seed before node dispatch):

- unselected controls, buttons, and checkboxes,
- integer comparisons, shifts, and bitwise operations,
- integer and bit casts,
- mutable table writes, soundfiles, standalone effectful memory forms, and
  unknown or non-unary foreign functions.

At these boundaries, a zero tangent means "no implemented forward rule", not a
general mathematical assertion. The primal signal is preserved.

Rules at non-differentiable points retain their emitted formula. For example,
the current derivative of `abs(x)` is `x / abs(x)`, which is undefined and may
produce `NaN` at `x = 0`.

## 7. Demonstration DSP Examples

The white-paper perspective on `fad` is easiest to understand if the use cases
are split into three tiers:

1. **Directly supported analysis patches**: feed-forward or recursion-local
   examples that compile today in the current `faust-rs` subset.
2. **Host-driven adaptive DSP**: the DSP computes losses and gradients, while an
   external host updates parameters.
3. **More ambitious differentiable systems**: neural or strongly adaptive
   patches that are architecturally enabled by `fad`, but still depend on a
   library layer or extra compiler work to become turnkey workflows.

### 7.1 Single-parameter gain sensitivity

This is the smallest useful example: measure how the output changes with
respect to a gain control.

```faust
os = library("oscillators.lib");

gain = hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 2, 0.01);
sig  = gain * os.osc(220);

process = fad(sig, gain);
```

Outputs:

1. `gain * osc(220)`
2. `osc(220)`

This is a direct sanity check: the derivative of `gain * x` with respect to
`gain` is exactly `x`.

### 7.2 Exact local slopes for nonlinear DSP

One of the most valuable practical uses of forward AD in DSP is extracting the
exact local slope of a nonlinear transfer function. That slope can be reused for
analysis, dynamic control, or antialiasing techniques that require derivative
information.

```faust
ma = library("maths.lib");

clipper(drive, x) = ma.tanh(drive * x);
slope(drive, x)   = fad(clipper(drive, x), x) : !, _;

drive = hslider("drive", 2.0, 0.1, 20.0, 0.01);
input = _;

process = clipper(drive, input), slope(drive, input);
```

Outputs:

1. the nonlinear waveshaper output,
2. the exact derivative of the waveshaper with respect to the input.

This is the kind of primitive needed by ADAA-style or local-linearization
techniques. Even when the final antialiasing strategy is more elaborate, `fad`
provides a compiler-native way to expose the slope without manually deriving and
maintaining the formula.

### 7.3 Two-parameter filter sensitivity

This example exposes both the primal filter output and the sensitivities of the
filter with respect to frequency and resonance:

```faust
fi = library("filters.lib");
no = library("noises.lib");

f = hslider("freq", 1000, 50, 5000, 1);
q = hslider("q", 1.0, 0.1, 10.0, 0.01);
x = no.noise;

process = fad(x : fi.resonlp(f, q, 1.0), (f, q));
```

Outputs:

1. filter output,
2. `d output / d f`,
3. `d output / d q`.

This is a good analysis patch when tuning a filter interactively.

This pattern is also the core of a **grey-box identification** workflow:

- define a parametric DSP block that is still interpretable as a filter,
- compare it to a target behavior,
- expose one gradient lane per parameter,
- update parameters in the host or in a supported recursive optimizer loop.

For example, a host can run a learning loop around the patch above and minimize
the distance between a target filtered signal and the current model output.

### 7.4 Newton-style root finding and implicit DSP equations

Another important class of use cases is solving implicit equations. In analog
modeling and zero-delay-feedback style formulations, one often needs both a
function value and its derivative with respect to the unknown.

```faust
ma = library("maths.lib");

error_eq(x, y) = y - ma.tanh(x - y);
newton_step(x, y) = y - (fad(error_eq(x, y), y) : /);

process = _, 0.0 : newton_step;
```

Conceptually, `fad(error_eq(x, y), y)` returns:

1. `F(y)`
2. `F'(y)`

and `:/` computes `F(y) / F'(y)`, so the full step becomes:

```text
y_next = y - F(y) / F'(y)
```

This is a compact and expressive way to build Newton-Raphson style solvers in
Faust source. In more elaborate patches, several such steps can be chained
together inside a loop or a recursive structure.

### 7.5 Recursive local gradient update

The next example uses `fad` inside a recursive state update:

```faust
target = hslider("Target", 0, -1, 1, 0.01);
lr     = hslider("LR", 0.05, 0, 1, 0.001);

state = step ~ _ with {
  step(prev) = prev - lr * grad with {
    loss = (prev - target) ^ 2;
    grad = fad(loss, prev) : !, _;
  };
};

process = state;
```

This is not just a toy. It demonstrates that `faust-rs` can differentiate a
loss with respect to the previous recursive state and immediately use that
gradient in the same recursive branch.

Architecturally, this is the bridge toward **real-time recurrent learning style
behavior**: the derivative is propagated alongside the recursive state instead of
being recovered later by backpropagating through stored history.

### 7.6 Host-driven optimization

For larger adaptive examples, one practical pattern is to keep the gradient
inside the DSP but close the optimization loop in the host. The repository
contains examples of this style:

- [tests/corpus/auto_chorus_stereo_fad_host.dsp](../tests/corpus/auto_chorus_stereo_fad_host.dsp)
- [tests/corpus/auto_wah_fad_host.dsp](../tests/corpus/auto_wah_fad_host.dsp)

The DSP computes:

- primal audio,
- loss,
- one or more gradients,

and the host updates the control parameters externally. This remains a useful
deployment pattern for integration with plugin hosts, experiments, and offline
training workflows, but it is **not** the main conceptual point of `fad`.

This is one recommended deployment pattern today for:

- auto-tuning filters,
- self-calibrating modulated effects,
- adaptive wah/chorus style processors,
- target-matching or system-identification experiments.

It keeps the DSP side simple and real time safe, while the host handles:

- parameter constraints,
- optimization schedules,
- batching or smoothing of gradients,
- persistence and UI integration.

### 7.7 Faust-expressed optimizers and learning loops

The more interesting long-term point is that `fad` is not only useful for
exporting gradients to a host. It also makes it possible to express the
**optimizer itself in Faust code**.

That direction is illustrated by the filter-training and physical/controller
design listings in Appendices A and B.

In those listings, Faust code computes:

- the model output,
- the error signal,
- one or more derivatives via `fad`,
- and the update rule for the trainable state.

So the learning loop can stay inside the DSP graph rather than being split
between DSP code and host code.

#### Faust-expressed adaptive optimizers

The Appendix A filter sketch is a better illustration of this idea than a
simple sign-descent patch. It keeps two trainable filter parameters, frequency
and resonance, in recursive state and updates them directly in Faust.

It already contains the main ingredients of a practical optimizer:

- multi-parameter `fad(..., (f_curr, q_curr))`,
- explicit gradient extraction,
- gradient clipping,
- smoothed first and second moments,
- epsilon-stabilized normalization,
- bounded parameter projection.

The relevant update law looks like this:

```faust
raw_grad_f = -err * df;
raw_grad_q = -err * dq;

grad_f = max(-1.0, min(1.0, raw_grad_f));
grad_q = max(-0.1, min(0.1, raw_grad_q));

m_f = grad_f : si.smooth(0.9);
v_f = (grad_f * grad_f) : si.smooth(0.999);

m_q = grad_q : si.smooth(0.9);
v_q = (grad_q * grad_q) : si.smooth(0.999);

f_n = max(20.0, min(20000.0, f_curr - lr_f * (m_f / (sqrt(v_f) + eps))));
q_n = max(0.1, min(10.0, q_curr - lr_q * (m_q / (sqrt(v_q) + eps))));
```

This is close to a compact Faust-native Adam-style optimizer. The important
point is not the exact schedule, but the fact that the entire update path is
still Faust DSP code:

- `fad` computes the local sensitivity,
- Faust computes the gradient signal,
- Faust computes moment estimates,
- Faust computes the normalized step,
- Faust clamps the updated parameters,
- recursion stores the updated parameter for the next sample.

In other words, the optimization law is itself a DSP program, not an external
host-side training loop.

#### More elaborate in-graph learning architectures

The Appendix B sketch shows a more ambitious direction. It combines:

- a physical or kinetic generator,
- a small neural-style controller,
- differentiable control prediction,
- and an optimizer written in Faust through `ad.fit_adam(...)`.

The important architectural message is that `fad` can serve as the derivative
source inside a broader Faust-defined adaptive system. Once the gradient exists
as an ordinary signal, nothing prevents Faust code from:

- smoothing it,
- clipping it,
- applying sign descent,
- feeding it into SGD,
- feeding it into Adam-like stateful updates,
- storing optimizer state in recursion.

That is closer to the true differentiable-DSP vision than a purely host-driven
story.

### 7.8 Higher-level differentiable DSP patterns

The whitepapers also point toward more ambitious use cases, such as:

- grey-box system identification,
- differentiable zero-delay analog models,
- neural or recurrent black-box audio models,
- optimizer libraries built on top of `fad`.

Those directions are technically aligned with the current architecture, but they
should be described carefully in terms of present support.

#### Grey-box system identification

This is already realistic with the current compiler. A representative pattern
is:

```faust
fi = library("filters.lib");
os = library("oscillators.lib");

target_f = 1200;
f_guess  = hslider("freq", 300, 50, 5000, 1);
q_guess  = hslider("q", 1.0, 0.1, 10.0, 0.01);
input    = os.osc(500);

target = input : fi.resonlp(target_f, 1.0, 1.0);
model  = input : fi.resonlp(f_guess, q_guess, 1.0);
loss   = (target - model) ^ 2;

process = target, model, fad(loss, (f_guess, q_guess));
```

This emits the target, the current model, the scalar loss, and one gradient per
parameter. That gradient can then be consumed either:

- by a host-side optimizer,
- or by a Faust-defined update stage stored in recursive state.

#### Black-box or neural-style modeling

The compiler-side differentiation engine is also compatible with the idea of
larger differentiable blocks, including recurrent ones. What is still missing
from the versioned repository is not the core `fad` transform itself, but a
supported higher-level library layer that would package:

- trainable parameter buses,
- optimizer state,
- reusable dense/RNN/LSTM building blocks,
- convenient parameter-update combinators.

So the correct statement today is:

- **the compiler infrastructure is in place for such systems**, especially for
  forward-mode, recursive local sensitivities, and Faust-defined adaptive
  updates,
- **the out-of-the-box library ergonomics are still an area for future work**.

That distinction is important because it keeps the white-paper vision aligned
with the current repository reality.

## 8. Current Limits and Practical Guidance

For day-to-day use, the following guidelines are accurate:

- use `fad(expr, seed)` with explicit seed variables,
- prefer the explicit parallel seed form `(a, b, c)` when differentiating with
  respect to multiple parameters,
- use `: !, _` to extract the tangent for a single-seed `fad`,
- expect robust behavior on feed-forward graphs and on the recursive families
  already covered by the corpus,
- use FAD inside or around clock-domain blocks when the clock itself is treated
  as scheduling data rather than a differentiation variable,
- use host-driven optimization when integration simplicity matters,
- but keep in mind that Faust-defined update laws are also a core intended use
  of `fad`, not an edge case.

The most important non-goal to keep in mind is that `fad` is not "differentiate
all Faust code automatically". It is a forward AD primitive over an explicitly
supported differentiable subset of Faust, with zero-tangent fallbacks that users
must account for when composing unfamiliar signal families.

## 9. Conclusion

`fad` gives `faust-rs` a meaningful differentiable DSP capability inside the
language itself. The primitive is explicit, compositional, and deeply
integrated with the Rust compiler pipeline:

- parser and boxes preserve the AD node,
- evaluation keeps it structural,
- propagation performs the actual signal differentiation,
- recursion is handled through augmented-state lowering and unified tangent
  lanes,
- backends consume the result as ordinary expanded DSP outputs.

That makes `fad` useful in two complementary ways:

1. as an analysis tool, to inspect local sensitivities of a DSP graph,
2. as a building block for adaptive or optimization-driven audio systems.

The implementation is broad enough to support serious experimentation,
especially on feed-forward graphs, recursive local gradient patterns,
clock-domain blocks, Faust-expressed optimizers, and host-driven adaptive
effects. The tracked corpus, runtime finite-difference checks, and golden tests
define the current evidence; broader differentiability claims require new rules
and tests.

## Appendix A. Illustrative Filter-Training Sketch

The two appendix listings are design sketches retained to explain in-graph
optimization. They are not versioned corpus fixtures, and Appendix B depends on
an external `ad.lib` helper library. Use the tracked examples and runtime tests
linked in the main text as the compatibility contract.
