**Date:** 2026-08-16

**Audience:** anyone who needs to render a Faust DSP offline and get numbers
out of it — checking that a filter is stable, that an oscillator does not
alias, that a compressor's attack lands where it should, or that a change to a
library function did not move its output.

**Companion:** the design note
[`faustprobe-generic-test-tool-design-2026-08-14-en.md`](../porting/faustprobe-generic-test-tool-design-2026-08-14-en.md),
which explains why the tool exists and what it deliberately does not do.

---

## 1. What it is

`faustprobe` compiles a `.dsp` through the Cranelift JIT, renders it offline
with a chosen excitation, and prints either the samples or a summary. It sets
controls, schedules changes at exact frames, sweeps parameters, and reduces a
render to a single number per channel.

It is a *measuring* tool. It hands over samples and scalars; it does not plot,
does not compare against a reference, and stops short of anything that needs a
spectrum rather than a number. Where that boundary falls is §9.

```
faustprobe [OPTIONS] <FILE>
```

Exit status is `0` on success and `1` on any error — an unresolvable control, a
value outside its control's range, a malformed argument, a program that does
not compile, a render that produced non-finite samples or went above
`--fail-above`. That makes it usable directly in a shell gate.

## 2. First contact

```bash
faustprobe -I /path/to/faustlibraries filter.dsp
```

With no other flag this renders 15 000 frames at 44 100 Hz, feeds an impulse to
every input, and prints CSV on stdout with a `#`-prefixed summary on stderr:

```
frame,out0
0,1.0
1,0.78
2,0.6083999
…
# frames=15000 sr=44100 window=0..15000 (15000 frames)
# out0: peak=1.0 rms=0.013047670922390269 dc=0.0003030302538287278 finite=yes peak_at=0
```

(`filter.dsp` is `process = _ : + ~ *(0.78);`, in single precision.) `peak_at` is
the frame of the first sample that reached the peak, `none` for a silent
render: whether a maximum is the onset, a control event or a level still rising
at the end of the render is the first thing to know about it.

The split matters when piping: `> samples.csv` keeps the data and lets the
summary reach the terminal.

## 3. Compiling and rendering

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-I, --import-dir DIR` | Faust library search path, repeatable |
| `--opt-level N` | Cranelift optimisation level (default 0) |
| `--sr HZ` | sample rate (default 44100) |
| `--block N` | frames per `compute` call (default 64) |
| `-n, --render N` | frames to render (default 15000) |
| `--fail-above LEVEL` | fail when a sample of the window exceeds `LEVEL` in magnitude, and say where first (see "When a render fails") |

### The compiler's options

The `faust-rs` options that choose the program or change the code the JIT
runs are forwarded to the compiler. They are `faust-rs`'s own declaration
(`compiler::CompileOptionArgs`), shared rather than copied: the same names,
single-dash spellings, defaults, value checks and help text as `faust-rs`.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-pn NAME`, `--process-name NAME` | compile the definition `NAME` instead of `process` |
| `-double`, `-single` | double- or single-precision samples (single, the default); the last one given wins |
| `-vec`, `-vs N`, `-lv 0\|1` | vector mode, its chunk size (default 32) and loop variant (default 0); without `-vec`, `-vs` and `-lv` have no effect, as with `faust-rs` |
| `-ss N`, `--scheduling-strategy N` | scheduling strategy (0 depth-first, the default) |
| `-mcd N`, `-dlt N` | delay-line thresholds: shifted copy up to `-mcd` (default 16), exact-size buffer above `-dlt` |
| `-ct 0\|1`, `--check-table 0\|1` | table index range check (default 1) |
| `-table-init runtime\|const`, `--table-init-sample-rate HZ` | how `rdtable`/`rwtable` content is produced |
| `-bra-tape N` | samples one `rad` reverse tape holds, the largest `--block` over which the gradients of a `rad` through delays and recursions are exact (default 8192, a power of two) |

One test of a library's test file, without writing a file around it:

```bash
faustprobe -I . -pn parametric_eq_demo_test -n 4096 --quiet tests/demos_tests.dsp
```

They apply to FILE and to the OTHER of `--compare`, and to both processes of
`--check determinism`; `--check width` changes only the precision.
`--process-name` is refused with `--eval`, whose expressions are the program,
and every one of them but the precision with `--nvoices`, whose voices are
compiled without them. `-mem0`, `-ec` and `-os` are declared but refused: they
would need a host that supplies a memory manager, calls `control`, or drives
`frame`. The options that describe an output (`-o`, `-lang`, `-a`, the dumps)
are not declared at all. Either way it is an error, never an option ignored.

### When the program does not compile

Nothing is rendered, the exit status is `1`, and the error on stderr is the
compiler's complete diagnostic, the one `faust-rs` prints: a summary line, then
the location, the source line with its markers, the notes and the suggested fix.

```
faustprobe: parse failed for reverb.dsp: errors=1, recoveries=0, diagnostics=1
reverb.dsp:2:21: error [FRS-PARSE-0001] Parsing error at line 2 column 21. Repair sequences found:
   1: Insert RPAR
  2 | process = _ : *(0.5 ;
    |                     ^ unexpected token
    |                ^ `(` opened here
  = fix (machine-applicable): insert `)`
```

So the probe answers "does it compile?" as well as `faust-rs` does, and for the
path it measures: the Cranelift JIT in the width asked, which is not the path
`faust-rs -lang cpp` takes. `faustprobe -n 1 file.dsp` is the shortest such
check. (The probe compiles through the C API, whose `error_msg` buffer is 4096
bytes by contract and carries the summary line only; the rest comes from
`getCCompleteCraneliftDSPFactoryError`, which any host of that API can call.)

**`--error-format json`** is the same failure for a program instead of a
person: the compiler's diagnostics-v2 report on stdout, one JSON document and
nothing else, and the summary line alone on stderr. It carries what the text
renders, typed: the code, the byte ranges in each source, the facts, and the
fixes with their edits, so that a machine-applicable fix is applied without
reading prose:

```json
"code": "FRS-PARSE-0001",
"fixes": [{
  "applicability": "machine_applicable",
  "edits": [{ "range": { "source_id": 0, "start": 38, "end": 38 }, "replacement": ")" }],
  "title": "insert `)`"
}]
```

It is the complete report, the one the WebAssembly bindings return (every
label, fact, trace and fix), with `"request": {"backend": "cranelift"}`; the
schema is that of `faust-rs --check --error-format json`
(`docs/user-diagnostics-guide-en.md`). Only a compile failure has a report: any
other error (a value out of range, a non-finite render, a failed comparison)
is text on stderr under either format, and stdout is then empty. FILE and the
OTHER of `--compare` are compiled before anything is printed, so the document
is alone on stdout. It is refused with `--eval`: the report's ranges are byte
offsets in the source that was compiled, which is then the file wrapped and
followed by the expressions, and a fix applied to the file at those offsets
would land elsewhere. The probe reads the report as any host of the C API
can, from `getCCraneliftDSPFactoryErrorDiagnostics` (the README's "Compile
errors" has the four such functions and their contract).

### Evaluating an expression: `--eval`

`--eval EXPR` probes an expression evaluated **in the scope of the file**
instead of the file's `process`. The file may be a `.lib`, which has no
`process` and could not otherwise be given to the tool; the expression sees its
definitions unprefixed, as inside the library, and its imports:

```
$ faustprobe --double -n 1 --in zero \
      --eval 'absorb_pole_exact(1709, 2.0, 0.5)' --eval 'absorb_pole(1709, 2.0, 0.5)' jot.lib
frame,"absorb_pole_exact(1709, 2.0, 0.5)","absorb_pole(1709, 2.0, 0.5)"
0,0.1981164814632339,0.5019283066233194
```

A question about a sub-expression costs a command, not a file with an `import`
and a `process`. The flag repeats, the expressions' outputs standing side by
side in the order given; an expression with several outputs gets `EXPR[0]`,
`EXPR[1]`, … (the columns are attributed by the number of outputs of each
expression, which a second, tiny program computes with `outputs(EXPR)`). A
header field that holds a comma is quoted, as CSV has it. With the statistics
comes a legend, `# eval out1 = EXPR`, which is what names the outputs under
`--quiet`, in a sweep (whose columns keep their `REDUCTION_outN` names) and in
JSON (an `eval` array).

Everything else applies to the program the expressions make: an expression
with inputs is a processor and is fed by `--in`
(`--eval 'fi.lowpass(2, 1000)' filters.lib` is an impulse response); its
controls are listed, set and swept, under the paths they have in the file, and
only those the expressions use exist; `--out`, `--fail-above` and `--train`
work as usual.

Faust evaluates lazily, and that decides what an `--eval` checks: **only what
the expression uses is evaluated**. `--eval 0 file.lib` therefore checks that
the library parses and that its imports resolve, nothing more: an undefined
symbol in a function nobody calls passes. To check a function, evaluate it; the
error then cites the library's own line:

```
$ faustprobe --eval 0 jot.lib               # passes: `gamma` is not evaluated
$ faustprobe --eval 'gamma(2.0)' jot.lib
faustprobe: evaluation failed for jot.lib: undefined symbol `oops`
jot.lib:81:14: error [FRS-EVAL-0002] undefined symbol `oops`
  81 | gamma(t60) = oops + exp(0.0 - 3.0 * LN10 / (t60 * ma.SR));
```

What an expression sees is the file's **top-level** definitions: one local to
a `with` block is not in scope, and the error says so. The file's own `process`
is not evaluated at all, so a program that does not define one, or whose
`process` is broken, can still be asked about its parts.

When the compilation fails, a location in the file is the file's own line (the
wrapper `--eval` puts around the file shares its first line, whose columns
alone are shifted), and a location in an expression is `<eval k>`, with the
expression as its source line:

```
$ faustprobe --eval scale --eval 'third(1) + quarter' small.lib
faustprobe: evaluation failed for small.lib: undefined symbol `quarter`
<eval 1>:1:12: error [FRS-EVAL-0002] undefined symbol `quarter`
  8 | third(1) + quarter
    |            ^^^^^^^ failing use
  1 | __faustprobe_env = environment{ // a small library
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ enclosing definition
  …
  = note: <eval 1> is `--eval 'third(1) + quarter'`, line 8 of the source as wrapped
  = note: `__faustprobe_env = environment{...` and `process = ...` are the wrapper `--eval` puts around the file
```

A literal argument is folded at compile time, a control is computed at run
time, and the two can differ in the last bit:
`absorb_pole(967, 2.0, 0.5)` reads `0.28400507460781155` and the same function
of two sliders at 2.0 and 0.5 reads `0.2840050746078115`. `--eval` is how to
tell which one a program's output is. It does not combine with `--nvoices` or
the impulse-test protocol.

`--double` is worth reaching for whenever the measurement is near the noise
floor, or when the DSP evaluates trigonometric functions of a large argument —
single precision loses accuracy there and the loss can be mistaken for a defect
in the DSP.

`--block` changes how the render is chopped, not what it computes: a correct DSP
gives the same samples at any block size. A result that moves with `--block` is
itself a finding.

## 4. Excitation

`--in MODE` chooses what enters the DSP:

| Mode | Signal |
|---|---|
| `zero` | silence — the right choice for a generator, which needs no input |
| `impulse` | 1 on the first frame of every input, then 0 (the default) |
| `impulse:CH` | the same, on channel `CH` only; a channel the program does not have is an error (`the program has 2 inputs, channels 0 to 1`), where it used to excite nothing and leave a silence to explain |
| `dc` | constant 1 |
| `white[:SEED]` | white noise; the seed makes it reproducible |
| `sine:HZ` | a sine at `HZ` |
| `file:PATH[:CH]` | the channels of an audio file, `.wav` (PCM or float), `.f64` or `.f32` (raw little-endian, mono); input `i` reads channel `i`, a mono file feeds every input, `:CH` picks one channel for all; silence past the end. The samples are read at `--sr`: give the file's rate there (a WAV at another rate gets a warning; a raw file carries none) |

```bash
faustprobe --in zero -n 4 gen.dsp          # a generator drives itself
faustprobe --in "white:7" reverb.dsp       # reproducible noise
faustprobe --in "sine:1000" clipper.dsp    # drive a nonlinearity
```

`--skip N` drops the first `N` frames from both the dump and the statistics,
which is how a start-up transient is excluded. `--every N` prints one frame in
`N`, for eyeballing a long render.

## 5. Controls

`--list-params` shows what the DSP exposes, with the kind of every entry
(`slider`, `nentry`, `checkbox`, `button`, `bargraph`), and exits:

```
$ faustprobe --list-params synth.dsp
path                                         kind            init        min        max       step
/osc/freq                                    slider         440.0       50.0     2000.0       0.01
/osc/gain                                    slider           0.5        0.0        1.0      0.001
/osc/level                                   bargraph         0.0        0.0        1.0        0.0
```

A bargraph is listed with the controls because it shares their address
space, but it is an output of the program: see "Bargraphs" below.

`--set PATH=VALUE` writes a control before rendering, repeatable. `PATH` may be
a full address or a trailing fragment of one, so `--set freq=100` finds
`/osc/freq`. An ambiguous fragment is reported rather than resolved arbitrarily:

```
$ faustprobe --set gain=1 stereo.dsp
faustprobe: `gain` is ambiguous, matches: /amb/left/gain, /amb/right/gain
```

Everything a render will write is checked before any render: an unknown
path, an ambiguous fragment, a bargraph or **a value outside the control's
range** in `--set`, `--sweep` or `--at` is an error, not a render:

```
$ faustprobe --sweep gain=0.5,1,7 --reduce peak synth.dsp
faustprobe: `gain`=7 is outside the range [0, 1] of /osc/gain (--clamp accepts it, clamped to the range)
```

A Faust host never writes outside a widget's range and a DSP is not compiled to
expect it, so the render would clamp the value; and a render at 1 in a row
labelled 7 looks like a measurement of 7. `--clamp` accepts such a value, and
says what it did: `# clamped /osc/gain: 7 -> 1` with the statistics (on stderr
before a sweep's rows), a `clamped` array in the JSON runs concerned, and sweep
rows that carry the value used, `1`, not the one asked for. With `--train` the
same holds for `--set`: a starting point outside the range is an error. A
`nan` is held by no range: under `--clamp` it is the control's initial value
(`# clamped /osc/gain: NaN -> 0.5`), and the render, a scheduled write or a
descent runs with that value, which is what the line says.

The bounds reach a host in single precision, whatever the program's width: a
range declared `[0.1, 0.7]` is known as `[0.100000001, 0.699999988]`. A value is
in range at that precision, so `--set x=0.7` is accepted, and a
double-precision program receives the `0.7` that was typed, not the float below
it; the error message prints the range as declared.
Under `--nvoices` the rule is the same, for the control of every voice and
for the effect's (§10).

`--at FRAME PATH=VALUE` writes a control at an exact frame. The render splits
its block so the change lands on the requested frame rather than at the next
block boundary — which is what makes an attack measurable:

```bash
faustprobe --at 0 gate=1 --at 1 gate=0 --in zero -n 5000 pluck.dsp
```

That pair is the idiom for a one-sample trigger on a `button`.

### Bargraphs

A `hbargraph` or `vbargraph` is how a Faust program shows a value: a level, a
detector's state, a learned coefficient, the parameters a preset selected.
The program writes it, once per sample; a host reads it. `faustprobe` reads
every bargraph after a render and reports it with the statistics,

```
$ faustprobe --double --quiet --set preset=4 jot_presets_bargraph.dsp
# frames=15000 sr=44100 window=0..15000 (15000 frames)
# out0: peak=1.2899768930149773 rms=0.04545460382493471 dc=0.0005037494887966796 finite=yes peak_at=1510
# out1: peak=1.2899768930149773 rms=0.04262056900393426 dc=0.00012935283157617836 finite=yes peak_at=1510
# bargraph /jot_presets_bargraph/T60_at_dc=1.9215
# bargraph /jot_presets_bargraph/T60_at_half_the_sample_rate=0.527
# bargraph /jot_presets_bargraph/gain=29.954550372874973
# bargraph /jot_presets_bargraph/long_lines=1.0
```

and, in `--format json`, as a `bargraphs` object in every run, keyed by path
(the key is absent when the program has none; the schema version is
unchanged, the key being an addition). `--bargraphs` puts them in the rows as
well: one column per bargraph, named by its path, after the outputs in the
per-frame CSV dump and after the reductions in a sweep's rows, where it is the
value at the end of each point's render:

```
$ faustprobe --double -n 2000 --sweep preset=0,4,7 --reduce rms --bargraphs jot_presets_bargraph.dsp
preset,rms_out0,rms_out1,/jot_presets_bargraph/T60_at_dc,...
0,0.048635476498202976,0.04863887969523716,0.29,...
4,0.06132501143284588,0.06132501143284588,1.9215,...
7,0.024210882299051106,0.024210882299051106,6.9848,...
```

A bargraph's zone holds the value of the last sample of the last `compute`
call, so in a per-frame dump a row carries the value at the end of the block
its frame belongs to: the time resolution is `--block` (and the blocks that
`--at` splits). Lower `--block` to follow a meter more finely. A bargraph
cannot be written: `--set`, `--sweep` and `--at` refuse one,

```
$ faustprobe --set level=1 synth.dsp
faustprobe: `/osc/level` is a bargraph, an output of the program: it cannot be set
```

since the program would overwrite the value at the next block and a sweep
over it would print identical rows that look like a measurement. `--bargraphs`
does not combine with `--format ir`, `--train`, the impulse-test protocol or
`--nvoices`.

## 6. Output formats

`--format` selects what the frames look like.

**`csv`** (default) is `frame,out0,out1,…`, directly pipeable.

**The text of a number** is, everywhere but in `.ir`, the shortest decimal
string that parses back to the same float **at the width the program was
compiled in**, plain or scientific according to the magnitude: `0.78`,
`0.6083999`, `3.3333333333333334e-8`, `NaN`, `inf`. A script that reads it
with `float()` gets the very sample, so a comparison with a reference can use
the tolerance the programs deserve rather than one set by the printing. Samples,
peaks, bargraphs and a control's bounds are at the program's width (an `f32` is
printed as the `f32` it is, `0.001`, not as its double,
`0.0010000000474974513`); means, RMS values, reductions and trained controls
are computed in `f64` and printed as such. `--precision N` prints `N` fixed
decimals instead, and `--precision 9` is the text this tool printed before it
had the flag, for anything pinned to it. Fixed decimals lose small values,
which is why they are no longer the default: `3.3e-8` prints `0.000000033`,
two significant digits, in either width.

**`--out FILE`** writes the rendered window (after `--skip`) to a file and
leaves only the statistics on stdout: the way to hand a long render to a
script, binary and exact instead of one decimal string per sample.

| Extension | Content |
|---|---|
| `.npy` | NumPy array, shape `(frames, outputs)`, `<f8` or `<f4` by width: `numpy.load` returns what parsing the CSV used to build |
| `.wav` | IEEE float, 64 or 32 bits, every output, with the sample rate; `--in file:` reads it back, so a render becomes the excitation or the reference of another |
| `.f64`, `.f32` | raw little-endian samples of a program with **one** output, the layout `--in file:` reads; `.f32` is refused for a double-precision program |

Every frame of the window is written: `--out` refuses `--every`, and also
`--sweep`, `--train`, `--format ir` and `--nvoices`.

**`ir`** reproduces the reference impulse-test text, header and zero-clamp
included, for byte comparison against the existing corpus:

```
number_of_inputs  :   1
number_of_outputs :   1
number_of_frames  :      3
     0 :  1.000000
```

**`json`** emits one versioned object. It is the format that carries the full
structure of a sweep.

`--quiet` suppresses the per-frame dump and prints only the statistics. Under
`--quiet` (or `--out`) those statistics *are* the output, so they go to stdout
and can be redirected; without it they annotate a dump that already owns stdout
and go to stderr.

### Subnormal samples

A decaying tail ends in subnormal numbers, the ones below the smallest normal
float (about `1.2e-38` in single precision, `2.2e-308` in double), and on a
target that does not flush them to zero each costs far more than a normal
number. When a window holds some, the statistics count them and say where they
start:

```text
$ faustprobe -n 200 --quiet halving.dsp          # process = + ~ *(0.5);
# out0: peak=1.0 rms=0.0816496580927726 dc=0.01 finite=yes peak_at=0 subnormal=23 subnormal_at=127
```

An impulse halved at every sample is `2^-k` at frame `k`: subnormal in single
precision from frame 127 to frame 149, and zero after. The count is **at the
width the program was compiled in**: the same render under `--double` has
none before frame 1023. The fields appear only when the count is not zero; the
JSON channels always carry `subnormal` and `subnormal_at` (null when there is
none). Only the outputs are seen: a subnormal inside a feedback loop that a
later stage absorbs, or that a gain lifts back, does not show here.

### When a render fails

A render with a non-finite sample is an error (except in `--format ir`, where
the artifact is what is judged), and the error says where it starts:

```
$ faustprobe --in dc -n 4000 --quiet --set drive=2 --at 1000 g=1.5 --at 3000 g=0.2 loop.dsp
faustprobe: render produced non-finite samples
  first: frame 1213, out0 (+inf); 2787 of 4000 frames affected
  controls written by then: /loop/drive=2 /loop/g=1.5
  last scheduled write before it: frame 1000, /loop/g=1.5
```

The first frame and its output, how many frames are affected (once and
recovered, or for good), the controls the command line had written by that
frame with their values then (the others are at their initial values), and the
last `--at` before it; a write scheduled after the failure is not listed.

A feedback loop that leaves its stable region runs away for hundreds of frames
before it overflows. `--fail-above LEVEL` fails the render at the first sample
of the window whose magnitude exceeds `LEVEL`, which is where to look:

```
$ faustprobe … --fail-above 1000 loop.dsp
faustprobe: a sample exceeds --fail-above 1000
  first: frame 1011, out0 = 1033.9707
  the render turns non-finite at frame 1213, out0 (+inf)
  controls written by then: /loop/drive=2 /loop/g=1.5
  last scheduled write before it: frame 1000, /loop/g=1.5
```

It also turns "stays bounded under these control changes" into an exit status:
schedule the jumps with `--at`, set a level no sane signal reaches. The level is
checked in the window only (a transient before `--skip` is not measured),
non-finite samples everywhere.

### Silence

When every output is **exactly** zero over the window, the statistics come with
the facts the tool has that explain it, as `# note:` lines (a `notes` array in
JSON; once, on stderr, for a sweep that is silent at every point):

```
$ faustprobe -n 4096 --quiet synth.dsp
# out0: peak=0.0 rms=0.0 dc=0.0 finite=yes peak_at=none
# note: every output is exactly zero over the window
# note: buttons and checkboxes at 0: /synth/gate
```

The other notes are `input is `zero` and the program has N input(s)` and, with
`--nvoices`, `no --note or --chord is scheduled: every voice stays free`. The
exit status stays 0, silence being sometimes the right answer, and a quiet
signal is not a silent one: the comparison is with zero, not with a threshold.

## 7. Sweeps and reductions

`--sweep PATH=V1,V2,…` renders once per value. Repeating the flag takes the
cartesian product, with the **last axis varying fastest**:

```
$ faustprobe --precision 9 --sweep freq=100,200 --sweep gain=0.1,0.9 --reduce peak dsp.dsp
freq,gain,peak_out0
100,0.1,0.099999368
100,0.9,0.899994314
200,0.1,0.099999368
200,0.9,0.899994314
```

Every point renders from a cleared instance, so one configuration cannot
contaminate the next.

`--sweep` combines with `--at`, which is what measuring a *triggered* instrument
against a swept parameter requires — attack level against pitch, for example.
The one rejected combination is a schedule that writes a control the sweep is
also driving, since the scheduled write would silently override the swept value
and the reported axis would not be what the render used.

`--reduce R` collapses each render to one number per channel:

| Reduction | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rms` | root mean square over the window |
| `peak` | largest absolute value |
| `energy` | sum of squares |
| `dc` | mean — non-zero flags an offset |
| `f0` | frequency of the strongest non-DC bin |
| `sfdr` | spurious-free dynamic range (§8) |
| `thd` | total harmonic distortion (§8) |

With `--format csv` a sweep prints one row per point, as above. With
`--format json` it prints the full structure, including the window each point
used. `--format ir` cannot hold a sweep and is rejected.

## 8. Measuring aliasing and distortion

`sfdr` and `thd` answer opposite questions about the same spectrum.

**`sfdr`** — spurious-free dynamic range — is the distance in dB from the
fundamental down to the loudest component *off* its harmonic grid. Larger is
cleaner. This is the measurement for a band-limited oscillator or an
antialiased waveshaper, where the harmonics are wanted and everything else is
not:

```
$ faustprobe --precision 9 --f0 187.5 --sweep k=1,3,6,14 --reduce sfdr --skip 2048 -n 10240 gen.dsp
k,sfdr_out0
1,303.736996229
3,304.525727177
6,304.945901462
14,306.857783832
```

**`thd`** is the companion and the opposite question: the energy in harmonics 2,
3, … relative to the fundamental. Here the harmonics are what is measured rather
than what is excluded — the right choice for characterising a saturator.

Both need a fundamental. `--f0 HZ` pins it; without it the strongest bin is
used, which is wrong for any signal whose loudest partial is not the fundamental
— a bright pluck, a filtered saw.

Two properties decide whether the number means anything.

**The window sets the floor.** Both use a Blackman-Harris window, whose
sidelobes are 92 dB down. An arbitrary tone therefore reads about **93 dB SFDR
however clean the DSP is**, and a result near that number measures the transform
rather than the signal. Choosing a frame count that puts `f0` on a bin centre
removes the leakage and takes the floor to numerical precision — that is why the
example above reads 304 dB.

**The window must be stationary.** Measuring while a spectrum decays smears
every partial, and the smearing appears as off-grid energy: a decaying pluck can
read 20 dB while being perfectly alias-free. Use `--skip` and `-n` to select a
steady stretch.

## 9. Where the tool stops

A `--reduce` returns one scalar per channel. That covers every property that can
gate a build: level, offset, dominant frequency, aliasing, distortion, and any
of them across a parameter sweep.

What it does not cover is anything needing a *vector*. Comparing a hundred
partials against a predicted curve, or tracking each of their decay slopes over
time, asks for a spectrum, and no further reduction can supply it. Those belong
in an analysis script reading the CSV — which is the intended division of
labour, not a missing feature.

One vector is the tool's own: the frequency response of a linear program
(§16). It is what is asked first of any filter, it is domain-neutral, and it
cost a sine sweep; and what must come with it, the check that the program
*has* a frequency response, needs renders that only the tool can make. Band
filters, decay times and modal fits stay in the scripts, for a second reason:
a numerical reference is worth something because it shares no code with the
tool it checks.

## 10. Polyphony

`--nvoices N` compiles `N` instances from one JIT and drives them through the
polyphonic wrapper ported from `poly-dsp.h`: allocation, stealing, mixing, and
reclamation of a releasing voice once it falls below `--voice-stop-level`
(default `0.00003162`, i.e. −90 dB, the value from `poly-dsp.h`).

```bash
faustprobe --nvoices 4 --note "60@0" --note "64@2000" -n 8000 --quiet synth.dsp
```

`--note PITCH[:VEL]@ON[..OFF]` plays one note; velocity defaults to 100, and
omitting `..OFF` holds it to the end of the render, which is how an attack is
measured without a release in the way. `--chord P1,P2,…[:VEL]@ON[..OFF]` plays
several pitches at once.

`--effect FILE` runs a separate effect DSP on the mixed output. A single file
declaring both `process` and `effect` has its effect extracted automatically,
the way `FaustPolyDspGenerator` does, so the flag is only needed to override
that guess or to pair files.

`--set` and `--at` broadcast: the control a path or fragment names is written
on **every voice**, and on the **effect** when it resolves there too, each
against its own range. They follow the rule of §5, and are checked before
anything is rendered: an unknown path, a fragment ambiguous on a voice or on
the effect, a bargraph, and a value outside the range are errors, the last
one naming where it would have landed:

```text
$ faustprobe --nvoices 2 --note 60@0 --set level=7 synth.dsp
faustprobe: `level`=7 is outside the range [0, 1] of /synth/level on every voice (--clamp accepts it, clamped to the range)
```

Under `--clamp` the value is clamped on the voices and on the effect alike and
reported (`# clamped /synth/level: 7 -> 1` with the statistics, a `clamped`
array in the JSON document). Until this was fixed the two halves of an
instrument disagreed, and neither said anything: a voice took `7` as it was, a
state no host produces, and the effect clamped in silence.

What a **note** writes is another matter: `poly-dsp.h` sets a voice's frequency
from the pitch, its gain from the velocity and its gate, whatever the sliders
declare, and so does the probe. Note 127 is 12 543.85 Hz on a `freq` slider that
stops at 1000, and reaches the voice as computed.

**`--in` reaches the voices.** `poly-dsp.h` hands the host's inputs to every
playing voice, and so does the probe: an instrument whose voices have an input
(a per-note filter on an external signal, a vocoder band) is excited by `--in`
as a scalar program is, every playing voice receiving the same signal, a
stolen voice its own half of the block. One held note under `--in dc` on a
voice that passes its input is `peak=1.0`; a chord of two is `2.0`. Until this
was fixed every voice was given silence, and `--in` was accepted under
`--nvoices` and meant nothing. For an instrument without inputs, the usual
case, nothing changes; a silent render of one that has some under `--in zero`
says so.

**Statistics and failures are those of a scalar render.** The header line adds
the voices (`# frames=300 sr=44100 nvoices=1 active_voices=1 window=0..300 (300
frames)`), and each output has the line of §6: `peak`, `rms`, `dc`, `finite`,
`peak_at`, and `subnormal=N subnormal_at=FRAME` when the mix holds subnormal
samples, counted at the instrument's width (a released voice decays through
them before it is reclaimed). The JSON channels carry the same fields, and the
document its `window`. `--skip`, `--fail-above` and `--time` apply.

A render that is not finite, or that exceeds `--fail-above`, fails, and says
what an instrument's failure is explained with: where it starts, the controls
written by then on the voices and on the effect with the values they took, the
last scheduled write before it, and **the notes held then**:

```text
$ faustprobe --double --nvoices 2 --note 60@0 --note 64@0..100 --at 500 fb=4 -n 2000 --quiet synth.dsp
faustprobe: render produced non-finite samples
  first: frame 1011, out0 (+inf); 989 of 2000 frames affected
  controls written by then: /synth/fb=4
  last scheduled write before it: frame 500, /synth/fb=4
  notes held then: 60 (on at frame 0)
```

Note 64, released at frame 100, is not among them; a write scheduled after the
failure would not be listed either. Until this was fixed the polyphonic render
kept statistics of its own, a peak and an RMS over the samples that were
finite: the render above printed `peak=1.0486543286696841e308 rms=inf` and
succeeded.

## 11. The impulse-test protocol

`--protocol impulse-test` pins every rendering condition to the reference
values — 44 100 Hz, block 64, impulse on every input, buttons held for the first
block, `.ir` output — and **rejects any flag that would perturb them**:

```
$ faustprobe --protocol impulse-test --sr 48000 dsp.dsp
faustprobe: --protocol impulse-test fixes the rendering conditions; remove --sr
```

Refusing rather than silently overriding is the point: a regression run that
was quietly mis-configured produces a `.ir` that looks valid and compares wrong.

One deliberate asymmetry in this mode: a non-finite sample is an error
everywhere else, but not here. The reference corpus contains DSPs whose expected
output contains NaN, and the artifact is what the comparison judges — the exit
code says whether the render was produced, not whether the DSP diverged.

## 12. Recipes

**Is this filter stable?**

```bash
faustprobe --in impulse -n 200000 --quiet filter.dsp
```

A `peak` that grows with `-n`, or `finite=no`, is the answer.

**Does this oscillator alias?**

```bash
faustprobe --in zero --f0 3000 --reduce sfdr --skip 4096 -n 12288 osc.dsp
```

Read §8 first: pin `--f0`, and prefer a frame count that puts it on a bin
centre.

**Where does this compressor's gain settle?**

```bash
faustprobe --in "sine:1000" --at 0 "threshold=-20" --skip 20000 --reduce rms comp.dsp
```

**Did this library change move anything?**

```bash
faustprobe --protocol impulse-test dsp.dsp > new.ir && diff old.ir new.ir
```

**What is this filter's response?**

```bash
faustprobe --double --eval 'fi.peak_eq(6, 1000, 200)' --freqresp 256 <faustlibraries>/stdfaust.lib
```

No file to write (§3, `--eval`), one render instead of a sine sweep, and a
refusal if the program is not a filter (§16).

**How does a parameter affect the output?**

```bash
faustprobe --sweep cutoff=100,200,400,800,1600 --reduce rms --in "white:1" filt.dsp
```

## 13. Host loops: `--train` and `--fd-check`

Some programs learn nothing themselves: they output a loss and, from `rad`,
the per-sample contributions of its gradient with respect to their sliders,
and leave the optimisation to a host (`tests/corpus/ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator.dsp`,
`ddsp_rad_gru_amp_host.dsp`, see `libraries/ddsp-examples-en.md`). The block
reverse sweep makes the sum of a gradient lane over a `compute` block the
gradient of the block's loss. `--train` is that host:

```bash
faustprobe --double -I libraries -I <faustlibraries> --in white:1 --block 256 \
    --train a1,a2 --fd-check --lr 0.01 --blocks 600 --every 100 \
    tests/corpus/ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator.dsp
```

`--train` names the controls, exact paths or unique suffixes, in the order
of their gradient lanes; `--loss-lane` (default 0) and `--grad-lane`
(default 1, the lanes of the controls follow it) say where the lanes are;
`--optimizer adam|sgd`, `--lr` and `--blocks` set the loop, `--block` the
block size, `--in` the excitation (`white:SEED` for a reproducible one,
`file:PATH` for a recording). Per block, the controls are written, the
block computed on the same instance (the state carries across blocks:
truncated backpropagation through time for a recurrent model), the loss
and gradient lanes averaged, the controls stepped and kept in their range.
With `--reset-per-block` every block starts instead from a cleared state
and from frame 0 of the excitation: one pass over the same response per
block, the offline calibration of a program whose target is a measured
response given by `--in file:` and whose block is the whole response
(`--block` its length, `--bra-tape` the next power of two, `--sr` the
rate of the recording). One CSV row per block, thinned by
`--every`, then the trained values, the first and last loss, and the lowest:

```text
block,loss,a1,a2
100,2.388789543804934e-4,-1.1946213530521381,0.7152390374663387
200,2.7272607473475966e-10,-1.2000005084309235,0.7200039032015184
...
600,3.462933533296437e-28,-1.1999999999999915,0.7199999999999901
# trained /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1=-1.1999999999999915
# trained /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a2=0.7199999999999901
# loss: block 1 4.615726e-1, block 600 3.462934e-28
# loss: minimum 3.462934e-28 at block 600
```

The GRU of the second example trains its 27 sliders the same way,
`--train wz1,wz2,...,bo --lr 0.005 --blocks 2000`, in a fraction of a
second; `--reduce`, `--at`, `--bargraphs`, `--out`, `--format ir`, the
comparisons of §14 and the impulse-test protocol do not combine with it.
`--format json` prints one document instead of the rows and the `#` lines
(below).

`--set` does, with two meanings. On a trained control it is the descent's
starting point, in place of the slider's initial value: `--set a1=-0.4
--train a1,a2` leaves from `-0.4` (a value outside the control's range is an
error, or under `--clamp` a reported clamp, as for a render), and `--fd-check`
checks the gradients there. On any other control it
is a fixed value, rewritten on every fresh instance and after every
`--reset-per-block` reset, since a reset restores the widgets' defaults: the
way to fit a program whose other controls select a variant (`--set exact=1`)
without editing it.

### What the descent says about itself

A loss and the controls are not enough to read a descent. What follows was
learned by reading tables afterwards, and is now said by the loop.

**A control that ends on a bound is stopped, not converged.** Keeping the
controls in their range is part of the algorithm; its having been active is
information. The fit of a Jot reverberator to a studio's impulse response
(300 passes over a response of 77 202 frames):

```text
# trained /jot_fit/lt0=-1.0596905749387509
# trained /jot_fit/ltpi=-3.5 (on its lower bound for 84 of 300 blocks, the last one included)
# loss: block 1 1.090139e-5, block 300 2.712435e-6
# loss: minimum 2.712433e-6 at block 248
# note: a control that ends on a bound is stopped, not converged: /jot_fit/ltpi
```

The high-frequency decay time wanted to go below what its slider allows: the
minimum is outside the range, and the value printed is the range's, not the
room's. A control that met a bound and left it says so too (`on its upper
bound for 3 of 6 blocks, not the last one`); one that never did is printed as
before. A block counts when its step leaves the control on the bound.

**The lowest loss, its block, and whether the descent left it.** The last
block is not the best one when the step is too large or the loss noisy. `#
loss: minimum` gives the lowest block loss and the first block that reached
it; when the last loss is more than ten times that minimum (a ratio, so for a
positive loss only), a note says so **with the controls that block ran with**,
which are the ones to keep:

```text
# note: the last loss is 992 times the minimum, which block 5 reached with /jumps/x=0.53125
```

With a streamed excitation (no `--reset-per-block`) every block sees another
stretch of the input, and block losses differ for that reason alone: ten is
a wide margin on purpose, and the note is a fact to look at, not a verdict.

**`--train-verbose`: the gradient behind each step.** A control that stops
moving has a vanishing gradient (a flat loss, or a minimum) or a vanishing
step (a learning rate too small for the gradient's scale), and the controls
alone do not say which. The flag adds one `grad_CONTROL` column per trained
control: the block's mean gradient, at the controls the block ran with.

```text
block,loss,a1,a2,grad_a1,grad_a2
200,2.7272607473475966e-10,-1.2000005084309235,0.7200039032015184,1.296604290850353e-4,7.069383848568409e-5
```

**A loss that is not finite** stops the descent with the block and the
controls it ran with (`the loss is not finite at block 12`, then `controls of
that block: ...`).

### `--fd-check`: is the gradient right, and where

`--fd-check` compares each gradient lane, summed over one block from a fresh
instance, with finite differences of the summed loss lane, and fails the
command when a relative error `|rad - fd| / max(|fd|, 1)` exceeds
`--fd-tolerance` (default 0.02). It is the first thing to run when a gradient
looks wrong:

```text
# fd-check /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1: rad 476.523699 fd 476.523699 relative error 3.27e-13
# fd-check /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a2: rad 335.872145 fd 335.872145 relative error 4.53e-13
# fd-check: block 256 frames, step 0.001, worst relative error 4.53e-13 (tolerance 0.02)
```

Where it runs is the flag's value:

| | |
|---|---|
| `--fd-check`, `--fd-check=start` | at the descent's starting point, before it; alone with `--blocks 0` |
| `--fd-check=end` | at the trained values, after the descent |
| `--fd-check=both` | both |

The value needs its `=`: `--fd-check FILE` is the bare flag followed by the
program. A descent is finished where the gradient is small *and* right, and a
gradient checked where the descent starts can be wrong where it stops (a
branch of a `select2`, a clipped value, a table read outside the region the
start explored): `end` checks there. Its lines are tagged and in scientific
notation, the gradient being small by then:

```text
# fd-check end /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1: rad 1.218757e-11 fd 2.030098e-8 relative error 2.03e-8
```

The check at the end fails the command after the rows and the trained values
were printed. On a bound, the differences step across it: the program
computes there as anywhere, the range being the host's business.

*The reference.* `fd` is the central difference at `--fd-step` (default
1e-3) and at half of it, extrapolated to a zero step, `(4 D(h/2) - D(h)) / 3`.
A plain central difference is off by the loss's third derivative times `h^2 /
6`, an error that does not shrink with the gradient: on the resonator above it
was the whole of the `3.98e-6` this check used to print, and at the end of
that descent, where the gradient is `1e-11`, it was `1.7e-2`, a hair under
the tolerance, for a gradient that is right to thirteen digits. The
extrapolation leaves a term in `h^4`. The JSON document keeps the plain
difference as `fd_plain`: by how much the two differ is the error the plain
one had. Below `--fd-step 1e-4` rounding takes over and the agreement
degrades again; in single precision finite differences say little at any
step, so check in `--double`.

### Grid, then descent: `--sweep` with `--train`

A non-convex loss wants a good starting point more than a good optimiser
(`libraries/optimizers-overview-en.md`). `--sweep` on trained controls
evaluates the loss of **one block** at every point of the grid, each from a
cleared instance with the `--set` controls written and the other trained
controls at their starting values, and the descent leaves from the best:

```bash
faustprobe --double -I libraries --in white:1 --block 256 --train a1,a2 \
    --sweep a1=-1.5,-0.5,0.5 --sweep a2=0.2,0.8 --lr 0.01 --blocks 600 --every 300 \
    tests/corpus/ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator.dsp
```

```text
# grid /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1=-1.5 /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a2=0.2 loss=1.11108788577618e64
# grid /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1=-1.5 /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a2=0.8 loss=1.5689772403942457e0
# grid /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a1=-0.5 /ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator/a2=0.2 loss=6.269462583346836e-1 (best)
...
# grid: 6 points, one block of 256 frames each; the descent starts from the best
block,loss,a1,a2
300,1.1748024609909106e-12,-1.2000004274129334,0.7200003990537392
...
# loss: block 1 6.269463e-1, block 600 2.387594e-26
```

The first point is an unstable filter, and its loss says so; a point where the
loss is not finite is listed and never chosen. The descent's first block is
the grid's block at the best point: the same number, which is a check that
the two agree. The last axis varies fastest, a tie keeps the first point, a
swept control must be a trained one (`--set` fixes any other), a value out of
range is an error or a reported `--clamp`, and on a control given both `--set`
and `--sweep` the grid decides. `--fd-check` then runs at the best point. This
replaces the two commands, and the parsing between them, that a grid start
took.

### The JSON document of a descent

`--format json` prints, at the end or with the failure that ended the run,
one document: `schema_version`, `dsp`, `sr`, and `train` with `options` (the
optimiser, `lr`, `block`, `blocks`, `reset_per_block`), `clamped`, `grid`
(`points[]` with `set` and `loss`, `best`), `fd_check` (`start` and `end`:
`checks[]` with `path`, `rad`, `fd`, `fd_plain`, `relative_error`; `worst_relative_error`,
`tolerance`, `passes`), `rows[]` (`block`, `loss`, `values`, and `grads`
always, thinned by `--every`), `trained[]` (`path`, `value`, `min`, `max`,
`blocks_on_lower`, `blocks_on_upper`, `ends_on`: `"lower"`, `"upper"` or
null), `loss` (`first`, `last`, `min`, `min_block`, `values_at_min`), `notes`
and, under `--time`, `timing`.

## 14. Comparing renders and checking invariants

"Did this change a sample?" is the question behind a refactoring, behind two
routes to one result (`fad` and `rad`, a preset and the adjustable program set to
its values), behind a new compiler version. The answer used to be two renders,
two parses and the maximum of a difference in a script. The maximum is also the
least informative answer: **the first frame that differs** says whether two
programs part at the onset, at a control event, or slowly.

### `--compare OTHER` and `--ref FILE`

`--compare OTHER.dsp` compiles a second program in the same process and renders
it under the same excitation, schedule and window. `--ref FILE` takes the
samples of a file instead (`.npy`, `.wav`, `.f64`, `.f32`: what `--out` wrote),
which must hold the same window. Per output:

```
$ faustprobe --double --in dc -n 512 --quiet --compare departs.dsp half.dsp
# frames=512 sr=44100 window=0..512 (512 frames)
# out0: peak=0.5 rms=0.5 dc=0.5 finite=yes peak_at=0
# compare: against departs.dsp, tolerance abs=0 rel=0
# compare out0: max_abs=9.99999999995449e-6 at frame 100, max_rel=1.9999600007908822e-5, first beyond tolerance: frame 100 (0.5 vs 0.50001)
faustprobe: the render differs from `departs.dsp` beyond the tolerance
  first: frame 100, out0: 0.5 vs 0.50001
  controls then: all at their initial values
```

An output whose every sample has the reference's bits reads `identical`. The
error carries the context a failed render has (§6): the controls written by
that frame and the last `--at` before it, which is what names the control event
two programs respond to differently. The exit status is 1 beyond the tolerance;
the lines above are printed first, and `--format json` prints its document
first too, with a `compare` object in the run (`agrees`, and per output
`identical`, `max_abs`, `max_abs_at`, `max_rel`, `first_beyond`).

**Tolerance.** A pair of samples agrees when `|a - b| <= ABS + REL * peak`,
`peak` being the reference's largest magnitude on that output: `--tolerance ABS`,
`--rel-tolerance REL`. Both default to 0, and then agreement is **bit
equality**, which is what a refactoring, another block size or a second
compilation owe. A non-finite sample agrees only with the very same bits.
`--compare-outputs 0,2` restricts a comparison, and the checks below, to some
outputs.

**Controls.** `--set` applies to both programs, a trailing fragment resolving in
each (`--set T60_at_dc=2` reaches `/jot_presets/...` and `/jot_reverb/...`),
and must resolve in both; `--set-a` and `--set-b` address FILE or OTHER alone.
`--at` applies to both. What the second program is given is validated like the
first's: unknown path, bargraph, value outside the range.

```bash
# a preset against the adjustable program set to the values it displays
faustprobe --double -n 44100 --quiet --set dry=0 --set wet=1 --set-a preset=4 \
    --set-b T60_at_dc=1.9215 --set-b T60_at_half_the_sample_rate=0.527 \
    --set-b gain=29.954550372874973 --set-b long_lines=1 \
    --rel-tolerance 1e-12 --compare jot_reverb.dsp jot_presets.dsp
```

The two programs must have the same number of outputs; their inputs may differ,
each being fed the excitation. `--eval` applies to FILE, so an expression can be
compared with a program.

### `--check`

Invariants of the render, each a second render compared with the one the command
makes. The flag repeats.

| Check | The second render | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `block[=N1,N2,...]` | a fresh instance at another block size (default 1, 7 and 512; the render's own `--block` is what they are compared with) | the same samples: a DSP that moves with the block size has a defect, or is a `rad` program, see below |
| `reset` | the same instance again, after a reset | the same samples. Every sweep point and every `--reset-per-block` pass relies on it: a reset that left state behind would contaminate them in silence |
| `determinism` | a second compilation and render in an independent process, with its own factory cache | the very bits, whatever the tolerance; the line says whether the two compilations gave the same program key |
| `width` | the other sample width (`--double` or not) | a **report** of the distance: `max_abs`, where, the first differing frame. A gate only when a tolerance is given |
| `all` | all of the above | |

```
$ faustprobe --double -n 8192 --quiet --check all jot_reverb.dsp
# check block=1 out0: identical
...
# check reset out0: identical
# check determinism: a second compilation gives the same program key
# check determinism out0: identical
# check width: this render in double precision against the single one (a report: no tolerance given)
# check width out0: max_abs=4.7656649737604084e-9 at frame 1708, max_rel=4.7656649737604084e-9, first difference: frame 502
```

A large `width` distance marks a numerically fragile program: a long
accumulation, a near-cancellation. `+(0.1) ~ _` is 3.0e-3 apart after 2000
frames (1.5e-5 of its value).

**`rad` and the block size.** The gradient lanes of a `rad` program are defined
per block (the block reverse sweep), so they do move with `--block` and
`--check block` fails on them, correctly. The loss lane does not:
`--compare-outputs 0` checks it alone. On
`tests/corpus/ddsp_rad_host_block_resonator.dsp`, `--check block=256` reads
`out0: identical` and reports `out1` and `out2` from frames 1 and 2.

`--compare`, `--ref` and `--check` look at one render: they do not combine with
`--sweep`, `--train`, `--nvoices`, `--format ir` or the impulse-test protocol.
JSON carries the checks as a `checks` array in the run.

## 15. What a run cost: `--time`

A compiler change that doubles the cost of a program shows in no sample.
`--time` adds the account of the run to the statistics:

```text
$ faustprobe -I <faustlibraries> -n 600000 --quiet --time zita.dsp
# out0: peak=0.14208001 rms=0.00045856125430063227 dc=1.4800001305893652e-6 finite=yes peak_at=9035
# time: compile 49.6 ms
# time: compute 34.6 ms for 13.6 s of audio (600000 frames in 9375 blocks): 393x real time
# time: worst block: frame 182144, 64 frames in 56.5 us, 3.89% of its 1.45 ms budget
```

- **compile**: the front end and the JIT, for FILE (with `--nvoices`, the
  voices and the effect).
- **compute**: the time spent in the `compute` calls and in nothing else: not
  the excitation, not the statistics, not the printing of the rows, which for
  a CSV dump is most of the wall-clock time. The factor is the audio's
  duration over that time: below 1 the program cannot run live on this
  machine.
- **worst block**: a host has a deadline per block, and the mean hides the
  block that would have clicked. The worst is the largest share of its **own**
  budget: the last block of a render and one cut by an `--at` are shorter, and
  so is their deadline. It is often the first, which pays for the cold caches.

The lines go where the statistics go. A sweep's rows and an `.ir` text have
no statistics block, and get one account for all their renders on stderr (`#
time: 3 renders`, then the three lines); the `.ir` text itself is untouched.
With `--train` the blocks are the descent's (the grid and `--fd-check` are not
counted), and the worst is named by its number: `worst block: block 31`.
`--format json` carries `timing` per run (`compute_s`, `audio_s`, `frames`,
`blocks`, `realtime_factor`, `worst_block` with `frame`, `frames`, `seconds`,
`budget_s`, `budget_fraction`) and `timing.compile_s` on the document.

These are the only numbers of the tool that differ from one run to the next,
which is why they are behind a flag: the default output being the same twice
is a property the tool is tested for. Compare two timings on a quiet machine,
with a render long enough for the clock (a second of compute is plenty), and
use the release build of `faustprobe`: the JIT-compiled code runs at the same
speed in either build, the compiler does not (four hundred one-poles in
parallel: compute 60.4 ms against 60.8 ms, compile 230 ms against 5.65 s in a
debug build).

## 16. Frequency response: `--freqresp`

The magnitude response of a filter used to take a sine per frequency: a render
each, a steady-state window to choose for each, for information that one
impulse response holds in full. `--freqresp N[:FMIN:FMAX]` renders that
response (`-n` frames) and evaluates its transform at `N` log-spaced
frequencies, from 20 Hz to half the sample rate or from `FMIN` to `FMAX`:

```text
$ faustprobe --double -I <faustlibraries> --eval 'fi.lowpass(4, 1000)' --freqresp 5:250:4000 stdfaust.lib
hz,mag_db_out0,phase_out0
250.0,-6.54311006605819e-5,-0.6580867865538877
500.0,-0.016760676978043003,-1.3588227827828372
1000.0,-3.0102999566397597,3.141592653589781
2000.0,-24.276023235260567,1.3531323337502958
4000.0,-49.06460729328156,0.6420005338117702
# freqresp: 5 frequencies from 250.0 to 4000.0 Hz, from the response of 15000 frames to an impulse on the input
# eval out0 = fi.lowpass(4, 1000)
# freqresp: linear and time-invariant within 1e-9 of the peak (homogeneity 1.83e-322, time_invariance 0.0, superposition 2.9005534296216863e-15)
# freqresp out0: peak=0.0542977764131825 peak_at=20, the last tenth of the window holds 0.0 of the energy
```

One pair of columns per output: `mag_db_outN`, `20 log10 |H|` (`-inf` where
the response is exactly zero), and `phase_outN`, the argument of `H` in
radians, in `(-pi, pi]`, not unwrapped (the fourth-order Butterworth above is
half a turn late at its cutoff, and 3.0103 dB down). The sum `H(w) = sum h[n]
exp(-j w n)` is evaluated at the frequencies asked for, so no bin grid decides
where the response is known; `1:1000:1000` is one frequency. The points
between the two bounds are rounded to twelve digits, and the response is
evaluated at the frequency that is printed. Against the sine route on a
resonant four-pole ladder, the two agree to `1e-13` dB.

The excitation is `--in impulse` (the default: every input at once, the
response to a common input) or `--in impulse:CH` for the responses from one
input; anything else is refused, and so is a program without inputs. `--set`
fixes the controls and `--sweep` varies them (below); `--eval`, `--double`,
`--sr`, `--block`, `--precision`, `--quiet` (the `#` lines alone, on stdout),
`--time` and `--format json` apply. `--reduce`, `--at`, `--skip`, `--every`,
`--out`, `--bargraphs`, `--fail-above`, the comparisons of §14, `--train`,
`--nvoices`, `--format ir` and the impulse-test protocol do not combine with
it.

### A family of curves: `--sweep`

`--sweep` gives one response per point, the swept controls heading the rows as
in a sweep of renders (repeat the flag for the cartesian product, the last axis
varying fastest):

```text
$ faustprobe --double -I <faustlibraries> --freqresp 3:500:2000 --sweep q=1,8 \
    --eval 'fi.resonlp(hslider("fc", 1000, 100, 10000, 1), hslider("q", 1, 0.5, 20, 0.1), 1)' stdfaust.lib
q,hz,mag_db_out0,phase_out0

# freqresp [q=1] out0: peak=0.0775513726569672 peak_at=9, the last tenth of the window holds 0.0 of the energy
# freqresp [q=8]: linear and time-invariant within 1e-9 of the peak (homogeneity 0.0, time_invariance 0.0, superposition 5.484530576646706e-15)

```

A resonant low-pass at its resonance: 0 dB for a quality factor of 1, `20
log10(8) = 18.06` dB for 8, a quarter turn late either way. **Every point is a
measurement of its own**: four renders from a cleared instance with the `--set`
controls and the point's written (after `--settle` frames of silence, when
given), its three checks, and its own lines, tagged with the point; a note
about a response cut while ringing names the point it concerns (`# note:
[a=0.999] out0 is still ringing ...`). A family with a member that is not a
frequency response is **refused whole**, nothing being printed, with the point
that broke: `--freqresp: at `drive=0.5`, the program is not linear ...`. A
swept value follows the rule of every write (§5): outside its range it is an
error, or under `--clamp` a clamp said once, the rows carrying the value that
was used. `--time` gives one account for all the responses.

### A program that has no frequency response is refused

The transform of an impulse response is a transfer function only if the
program is linear and time-invariant, and nothing in a Faust program says
whether it is. So three more renders come first, each compared with what the
response `h` to the unit impulse predicts:

| Property | Excitation | Expected | Who fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| homogeneity | an impulse of `-0.5` | `-0.5 h` | a saturator, a rectifier (hence the negative factor), a threshold, an offset or a generator mixed in |
| time invariance | the impulse 37 frames later | `h`, 37 frames later | an LFO on a coefficient, a tremolo, an envelope, a noise source, **a smoothed control that has not settled** |
| superposition | `1` at frame 0 and `0.5` at frame 1 | `h[n] + 0.5 h[n-1]` | a median, a min or max over neighbouring samples: homogeneous, time-invariant, and not additive |

A program that fails is not measured, and the error says which property broke
and at which frame first:

```text
$ faustprobe --double --eval 'ef.cubicnl(0.5, 0)' --freqresp 8 stdfaust.lib
faustprobe: --freqresp: the program is not linear and time-invariant: its impulse response has no transfer function to give
  homogeneity: the response to an impulse of -0.5 is not -0.5 times the response to an impulse of 1
  first: frame 0, out0: -0.6666666666666667 where -0.33333333333333337 was expected (tolerance 1e-9 of the peak)
  usual cause: a saturation, a rectifier, a threshold, or an output that does not come from the input
  a program that is not linear is measured at one level and one frequency at a time: --in sine:HZ --skip N --reduce rms
```

When the render of silence explains the refusal (a DC offset, an oscillator
mixed in), the error adds `with no input at all the program outputs a signal
(out0 peaks at 0.25)`.

The factors are powers of two, so that in a linear program the first two
checks hold **to the bit**: scaling by a power of two and shifting in time
commute with every rounding. What they print is then a measurement:
`homogeneity 0.0` above, and `6.1e-18` for `re.zita_rev1_stereo`, which with
no input at all outputs `2e-20`, its guard against subnormals. Superposition
holds to rounding (`1e-15`), hence a tolerance: `--linearity-tolerance REL`,
relative to the expected response's peak, by default `1e-9` in double
precision and `1e-4` in single, where the rounding of a resonant filter is
that large; measure in `--double`.

These are necessary conditions, observed at the amplitudes 1 and 0.5 of one
excitation. A limiter whose threshold the impulse response never reaches
passes, and is linear there; a nonlinearity 120 dB down (`x + 1e-6 x^3`) is
refused by default and accepted under `--linearity-tolerance 1e-5`.

### `--settle N`: smoothed controls

Most programs smooth their sliders (`si.smoo`), and a smoothed gain is an
envelope until it has reached its value: after a reset, the program *is*
time-varying, and is refused for it, with the hint:

```text
$ faustprobe --double --eval 'dm.zita_light' --freqresp 3:100:10000 -n 100000 stdfaust.lib
  time invariance: the response to an impulse at frame 37 is not the response to an impulse at frame 0, 37 frames later
  first: frame 37, out0: 0.0093484857615766 where 0.0002505936168136361 was expected (tolerance 1e-9 of the peak)
  ...
  a smoothed control (si.smoo) is such an envelope until it has settled: --settle N renders N frames of silence before the impulse
```

`--settle 44100` renders a second of silence first; the impulse lands on frame
44100, and the response and its `-n` frames are counted from there (`to an
impulse on all 2 inputs at once at frame 44100`). A pole of 0.999, that of
`si.smoo`, is within `1e-9` after 21 000 frames.

### The window

A response still ringing at the last frame is truncated, and the transform is
that of the truncation. The last `# freqresp outN` line gives the share of the
response's energy held by the last tenth of the window; above `1e-6` a note
says the response was cut and by about how much the magnitude near a resonance
is off (the square root of that share):

```text
$ faustprobe --double -n 1000 --freqresp 4 --quiet slow.dsp          # process = + ~ *(0.999);
# freqresp out0: peak=1.0 peak_at=0, the last tenth of the window holds 0.03463246878183396 of the energy
# note: out0 is still ringing 1000 frames after the impulse: what -n cut off is of the order of the last tenth's share, and near a resonance the magnitude is off by about its square root (18.6%); raise -n
```

An output that nothing reaches from the excited input says so (`the response
is exactly zero: nothing reaches this output from input 1`) and reads `-inf`.

### JSON

`--format json`: `schema_version`, `dsp`, `sr`, `frames`, and `freqresp` with
`input` (null for every input), `settle`, `hz[]` and `runs[]`, one run per
sweep point and a single one without a sweep, as in a render's document. A run
holds `set` (the swept controls at that point, empty without a sweep),
`linearity` (`tolerance`, `shift`, and the three measured departures
`homogeneity`, `time_invariance`, `superposition`), `outputs[]` (`output`,
`mag_db[]`, `phase[]`, `peak`, `tail_energy_fraction`), and `clamped`, `notes`,
`timing` when there is something to say; `eval` and `timing.compile_s` are on
the document. A magnitude of `-inf` is `null`. (For the few hours between the
introduction of `--freqresp` and that of its sweep, `linearity` and `outputs`
sat directly under `freqresp`.)
