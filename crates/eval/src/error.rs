/// the evaluator, but without global mutable state — stats are accumulated locally and
/// returned by value.
///
/// # C++ correspondence
///
/// | Rust field | C++ equivalent | C++ location |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `env_layers_pushed` | `gStats.fEnvLayersPushed` | `environment.cpp` — `pushNewLayer` |
/// | `env_lookups` | `gStats.fEnvLookups` | `environment.cpp` — `searchIdDef` |
/// | `env_lookup_total_depth` | `gStats.fEnvLookupTotalDepth` | `environment.cpp` — `searchIdDef` loop |
/// | `loop_detector_max_depth` | (no direct equivalent — C++ uses `gGlobal->gRecursionLimit`) | |
/// | `nodes_evaluated` | (not tracked in C++) | |
///
/// # Interpretation
///
/// These ratios describe the intended interpretation once all counters are wired:
///
/// - **`env_lookups / nodes_evaluated`**: average lookups per evaluated node. High values (> 3)
///   indicate deeply bound symbols that might benefit from flattening or interning.
/// - **`env_lookup_total_depth / env_lookups`**: average scope depth traversed per lookup.
///   Values > 3 indicate deep scope chains where caching may help.
/// - **`env_layers_pushed / nodes_evaluated`**: scope-push frequency. High values for iterative
///   forms (`ipar`/`iseq`) are expected.
///
/// As of the current port, instrumentation is still incremental: the field meanings are stable,
/// but not every evaluator path updates every counter yet. Consumers should therefore treat these
/// values as progressively improving telemetry, not as a fully complete profiling contract.
/// A non-fatal finding of the evaluator.

/// the reference compiler prints under `-wall`; they never change the result.
