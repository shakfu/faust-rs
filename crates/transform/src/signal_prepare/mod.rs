//! Signal-forest preparation before fast-lane FIR lowering.
//!
//! # Source provenance (C++)
//! - `compiler/normalize/normalform.cpp` (`deBruijn2Sym(...)`, `typeAnnotation(...)`)
//! - `compiler/box_signal_api.cpp` (`boxesToSignalsMLIR(...)`)
//! - `compiler/signals/sigtyperules.cpp` (reduced type inference subset)
//!
//! # Stage scope
//! The pipeline implemented here applies a **fixed linear sequence of ~16 passes**
//! to the propagated signal forest, converting it into the staged shape expected by
//! `signal_fir`.  The sequence is:
//!
//! ```text
//! 2.1  clone forest into a fresh private TreeArena
//! 2.2  de_bruijn_to_sym        (de Bruijn → SYMREC / SYMREF)
//! 2.3  canon_unary_rec         (canonicalize unary projection indices)
//!      └─ assert_sym           (W4: no de Bruijn remains)
//! 2.4  retype #1               (sig_types fresh before promote #1)
//! 2.5  promote #1              (insert SignalPromotion casts)
//! 2.6  retype #2               (sig_types fresh before simplify #1)
//! 2.7  simplify #1             (algebraic simplification)
//! 2.8  merge_iso_rec           (merge isomorphic SYMREC groups)
//! 2.9  retype #3               (sig_types fresh before simplify #2)
//! 2.10 simplify #2             (algebraic simplification)
//! 2.11 canon_one_sample_delays (Delay(x,1) → Delay1(x))
//!      └─ assert_d1            (W4: no Delay(_, 1) remains)
//! 2.12 retype #4               (sig_types fresh before promote #2)
//! 2.13 promote #2              (second promotion pass)
//!      └─ assert_sym_d1        (W4: Sym + D1 preserved)
//! 2.14 retype #5               (final sig_types for PreparedSignals)
//! 2.15 derive_simple_types     (SigType → SimpleSigType)
//! 2.16 verify                  (postconditions; _verified entry only)
//! ```
//!
//! The five re-types (steps 2.4 / 2.6 / 2.9 / 2.12 / 2.14) are driven by the
//! private `Staging` driver, which owns `sig_types` and guarantees it is fresh
//! before every typed pass.  No `sig_types_*` snapshot locals are threaded by
//! hand — the schedule is structural.
//!
//! Reduced typing deliberately stops short of the full C++ type lattice. The
//! goal is only to support the upcoming promotion pass and to feed `signal_fir`
//! with enough information for delay/recursion/table lowering.
//!
//! # Boundary contract
//! Input signals may still contain:
//! - de Bruijn recursion groups,
//! - mixed integer/real numeric expressions,
//! - table and clock-family nodes emitted by propagation.
//!
//! Output signals returned by [`prepare_signals_for_fir`] satisfy these
//! fast-lane invariants:
//! - recursion is rewritten to symbolic `SYMREC` / `SYMREF`,
//! - one reduced prepared type is available for each reachable node,
//! - casts needed by the current FIR lowerer have already been inserted,
//! - the original source arena is left untouched.
//!
//! The module also exposes an explicit verification boundary (implemented in
//! the `verify` submodule, `signal_prepare/verify.rs`):
//! - [`PreparedSignals::verify`] checks those postconditions on an already built
//!   staging forest,
//! - [`prepare_signals_for_fir_verified`] returns a wrapper that certifies the
//!   prepared forest passed the boundary checks before reaching FIR lowering.
//!
//! The two structural canonicalization rewrites (`canonicalize_unary_rec_projections`
//! and `canonicalize_one_sample_delays`) are implemented in the `rewrites` submodule
//! (`signal_prepare/rewrites.rs`). See that module for their specifications and
//! explicit C++ parity limitations.
//!
//! # Adaptation status
//! This is an adapted Rust staging phase rather than a 1:1 copy of one single
//! C++ class:
//! - `deBruijn2Sym(...)` is applied forest-wide like the C++ normalization path,
//! - reduced typing keeps only the distinctions currently needed by the
//!   fast-lane instead of the full C++ signal type lattice,
//! - the promotion pass ports only the `SignalPromotion` subset required before
//!   `signal_fir`,
//! - algebraic simplification then runs on the promoted forest before the
//!   final type snapshot is exposed to FIR lowering,
//! - `Delay(x, 1)` is then canonicalized back to `Delay1(x)` so downstream
//!   FIR consumers see one stable unary-delay form.
