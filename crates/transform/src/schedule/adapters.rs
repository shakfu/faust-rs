//! [`ScheduleDag`] adapter for [`crate::hgraph::Digraph`].
//!
//! Only immediate edges (`Edge::delayed == false`) order the schedule — a
//! delayed dependency is a same-tick *placement* hint, not a same-tick
//! *ordering* edge (`crate::hgraph` module docs). Edge targets outside the
//! graph's own owned node set (`Digraph`'s docs: "Edge targets may be
//! foreign") are also dropped, keeping the [`ScheduleDag`] contract that
//! every returned dependency is itself a node of `nodes()`.
//!
//! `LoopGraph`'s adapter lives in `signal_fir::loop_graph` instead of here:
//! `LoopGraph` is `pub(crate)` behind a private `signal_fir::loop_graph`
//! module path, so this crate-external file cannot name it. Placing the impl
//! is not a visibility choice about `ScheduleDag` (`pub`, reachable
//! anywhere in the crate) — only about where `LoopGraph` itself can be
//! named, which is `signal_fir` and its descendants.
