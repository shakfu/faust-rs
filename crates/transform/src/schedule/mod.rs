//! Generic dependency-DAG scheduler core (vectorization port plan phase P1).
//!
//! # Source provenance (C++)
//! - `compiler/DirectedGraph/Schedule.hh` — `schedule<N>`, `dfschedule`,
//!   `bfschedule`, `spschedule`, `rbschedule`.
//! - `compiler/DirectedGraph/DirectedGraphAlgorythm.hh` — `roots`,
//!   `parallelize`, `reverse`, `interleave`, `recschedulenode`,
//!   `recschedule`.
//! - Plan:
//!   `porting/vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md`
//!   §2.5 (`-ss` behavior), §4.1 (generic scheduling contract), §5.4 (formal
//!   scheduling contract), "P1 - Generic scheduler core".
//! - Formal cross-check: `porting/vector-mode-scheduling-formal-spec.lean`
//!   (`SchedulingStrategy`, `decodeStrategy`, `verifySchedule`,
//!   `diamondGraph`).
//!
//! # Edge convention
//! An edge `consumer -> dependency` — i.e. `dag.dependencies(consumer)`
//! contains `dependency` — means **the dependency must be scheduled before
//! the consumer**. This is the C++ `digraph<N>::destinations` convention: a
//! node's "destinations" are what it depends on, not what depends on it. A
//! **root** is a terminal consumer with no incoming edge (nothing depends on
//! it); C++ `roots(G)` computes it the same way this port does — count how
//! often each node appears as *someone else's* dependency, and keep the ones
//! whose count is zero.
//!
//! # Determinism rule
//! Every strategy ties by **ascending node key** (`Ord` on
//! [`ScheduleDag::Node`]), never by hash-map iteration order:
//! `BreadthFirst`/`ReverseBreadthFirst` sort level buckets by
//! `(level, key)`; `DepthFirst`/`Special` visit `roots(G)` — itself
//! ascending by the [`ScheduleDag`] contract — in that order. **C++ tie
//! order is explicitly not a parity target**: C++ signal ties follow `Tree`
//! pointer identity and vector-loop ties follow `Loop*` pointer identity,
//! neither of which is reproducible or meaningful across runs or platforms.
//! What *is* a parity target is level **membership** (which nodes share a
//! computed height) and dependency **validity** (every produced order is a
//! legal topological order) — both checked structurally by
//! [`verify_schedule`], and, for the literal algorithms, cross-checked by
//! hand against the plan's worked examples and the Lean `diamondGraph`
//! fixture (`tests::exact_orders`).
//!
//! # API mapping status
//!
//! | Item | Status | Rationale |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`SchedulingStrategy`] | `adapted` | Same four strategies as `-ss`, as a Rust `enum` instead of an integer flag; [`SchedulingStrategy::decode`] matches the C++ `0 / 1 / 2 / n>=3` split exactly. |
//! | [`ScheduleDag`] | `adapted` | C++ has no such trait — `digraph<N>` is used directly by every algorithm. The trait is the Rust seam letting one algorithm implementation serve every graph shape (`hgraph::Digraph`, `signal_fir::LoopGraph`, future callers) instead of copying the four algorithms per graph type. |
//! | [`schedule`] | `adapted` | Literal port of the four algorithms, plus typed, total cycle/self-edge detection that C++ does not perform (C++ assumes a DAG and recurses/loops unconditionally). |
//! | [`verify_schedule`] | `adapted` | No C++ equivalent; mirrors the Lean `verifySchedule` as an independent postcondition checker (plan §5.10) never reusing a scheduling algorithm. |
//!
//! # Status
//! Purely additive: nothing in the production compile path constructs a
//! [`ScheduleDag`] or calls [`schedule`] yet — phase P2 threads the public
//! `-ss` / `--scheduling-strategy` option through the compiler, and phase P3
//! activates scalar scheduling. `hgraph::schedule` keeps its own literal
//! depth-first walk unchanged; it is not yet expressed in terms of this
//! module.
