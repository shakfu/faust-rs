//! P3 schedule-conformance comparison (observation-only).
//!
//! This module was introduced for the pre-activation shadow audit required by
//! `vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md` P3. The
//! report remains useful after activation: it compares actual first lowering
//! with the accepted `Hsched` over the same prepared forest.
//!
//! An empty inversion set proves that every materialized same-tick dependency
//! was emitted first. Exact intersection equality additionally proves that a
//! non-recursive graph was driven directly by the selected strategy. Recursive
//! bodies may differ because Rust must expand them inside their `SYMREC`
//! binder; that context-bound expansion is a fixed execution unit.
//!
//! The comparison never mutates FIR and never panics. `Hgraph` includes inline
//! nodes that need not receive a separate FIR materialization, so exact order
//! is deliberately checked only on the common node set.
