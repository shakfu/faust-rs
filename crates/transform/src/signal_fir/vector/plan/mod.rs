//! Construction of the strategy-independent vector plan (loop placement,
//! transports, epochs, fused serial groups).
//!
//! # C++ provenance and adaptation
//! Placement uses `DAGInstructionsCompiler::needSeparateLoop` from
//! `compiler/generator/compile_vect.cpp` and
//! `compiler/generator/dag_instructions_compiler.cpp`. Unlike the C++ pass,
//! this builder never rediscovers occurrence, delay, clock, recursion, type,
//! or effect facts while lowering. It accepts only an independently checked
//! [`VerifiedDecorationCertificate`](crate::signal_fir::decoration_verify::VerifiedDecorationCertificate), allocates stable loop/transport ids, and
//! then calls the independent [`verify_vector_plan`](crate::signal_fir::vector::verify::verify_vector_plan) trust boundary.
//!
//! The result deliberately contains no scheduling order and this API has no
//! `SchedulingStrategy` parameter. `-ss` is applied later, independently in
//! each fixed epoch. Delayed inter-loop uses contribute ordering edges but no
//! immediate-value transports: this is the Rust counterpart of the C++ delay
//! line loop preceding its readers within a vector chunk. P5 still owns
//! region-aware FIR routing; P6 owns complete clock-domain epochs and
//! delay/recursion storage geometry.
//!
//! Fused serial groups are an adapted representation of the C++ mutable
//! `CodeLoop` nesting used for state-mediated sample dependencies. Production
//! construction closes sample-required occurrence/data ancestors, every
//! dangerous delayed-read/carrier relation, its same-sample path, and all
//! conflicting effect users. Symbolic recursion carriers and table containers
//! remain structural: their executable children, rather than the containers,
//! enter the sample closure. The independent checker reconstructs these sets
//! before routing can consume the certificate.
//!
//! Development history: P4.4 of
//! `porting/vector-mode-signal-level-analysis-cpp-port-plan-2026-07-10-en.md`.
