//! Strategy-independent `VectorPlan` DTO and its independent verifier
//! (`verify_vector_plan`).
//!
//! Vectorization port plan phases P4.4/P5 (formal gate: "before emission,
//! `verify_vector_plan` establishes `L-*`, typed transports, region
//! visibility, `VecSafe`…") and certified plan "R3 - Vector plan certificate
//! at L2/L3". This is the vector-plan analogue of the R1 schedule certificate
//! (`crate::schedule::certificate`): a canonical DTO mirroring the
//! `vectorPlan` shape of
//! `porting/schemas/vector-verification-certificate-v2.schema.json`, plus a
//! checker that re-derives every invariant from the plan's own fields. Schema
//! v2 adds lockstep bundles and explicit transport layouts; v1 plans are not
//! silently accepted by the v2 verifier.
//!
//! The checks mechanize the Lean `VectorPlanCertificate` obligations
//! (`porting/vector-mode-scheduling-formal-spec.lean`): unique ids, exact
//! epoch coverage with unique ranks, ownership/root agreement, inline
//! duplicability, complete non-self loop edges, an acyclic induced graph per
//! epoch, well-typed transports, monotone cross-epoch barriers, serial
//! recursion/island loops, and a `VecSafe` witness for every vectorizable
//! loop.
//!
//! # Scope, deliberately bounded (first P5 slice)
//! Additive and **not wired into FIR emission**. P4.4 constructs accepted plans
//! from verified decorations; P5 will route FIR through those plans. Deferred,
//! matching the certified plan's own staging:
//! - **effect commutation** (`L-Effects` for incomparable loops): the DTO
//!   retains P4.3a's exact effect identities and the verifier derives
//!   duplicability and local `VecSafe` instead of trusting producer booleans,
//!   but it does not yet prove pairwise commutation of independent effectful
//!   loops (the plan calls this the hard case; effect edges are
//!   producer-supplied here);
//! - **JSON (de)serialization / `plan_hash`** (R2 canonical-boundary work): a
//!   plan is identified by its Rust type, not a runtime tag or hash.
