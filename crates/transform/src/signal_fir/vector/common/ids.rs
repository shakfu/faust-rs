//! Prepared-signal and artifact ID indexing (plan R4.2).
//!
//! Every vector stage builds `key -> record` maps over certificate rows.
//! The raw `.map(|x| (x.id, x)).collect::<BTreeMap<_, _>>()` idiom silently
//! keeps the *last* row on a duplicate key; these helpers reject duplicates
//! instead, so a malformed artifact fails loudly at the indexing boundary.
//! On artifacts that already passed their uniqueness checks the behavior is
//! identical.
