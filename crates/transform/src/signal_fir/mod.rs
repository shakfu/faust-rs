//! Signal→FIR lowering: scalar path, checked vector path, and selection.
//!
//! # Inputs and outputs
//! Entry points take the propagated signal forest, the arity contract, the
//! grouped [`UiProgram`], optionally the propagation-owned
//! `ClockDomainTable`, and [`SignalFirOptions`]. They return a
//! [`SignalFirOutput`]: an owned [`FirStore`] with the module root, plus the
//! observable vector status (`vector_pipeline_status`,
//! `vector_effective_mode`, `vector_pipeline_detail`) and diagnostics.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//! 1. **Plan** — validate options and the top-level signal/arity contract.
//! 2. **Prepare** — [`crate::signal_prepare`] clones the forest into a
//!    private staging arena, normalizes, types, and verifies it
//!    (`VerifiedPreparedSignals`).
//! 3. **Clock/dependency analysis** — [`crate::clk_env`] infers clock
//!    environments (for `ondemand`/`upsampling`/`downsampling` programs),
//!    [`crate::hgraph`] builds the hierarchical dependency graph, orients
//!    effect conflicts (scalar path), and schedules it under the selected
//!    [`SchedulingStrategy`].
//! 4. **Selection** — with [`ComputeMode::Vector`], the checked vector
//!    pipeline under [`vector`] runs first; on acceptance its verified module
//!    is returned. On a named rejection it **fails closed** to scalar
//!    lowering and reports [`VectorPipelineStatus::Fallback`].
//! 5. **Scalar lowering** — `module::build_module` lowers the prepared forest
//!    along the accepted schedule (delay strategies under `delay/`, recursion,
//!    tables, UI, clocked regions, and reverse-AD carriers included).
//!
//! # Fallback semantics
//! A vector fallback is observable, never silent: the stable reason codes are
//! [`VectorFallbackReason::code`] (`FRS-VEC-FALLBACK-*`), the returned FIR is
//! scalar-shaped, and [`VectorEffectiveMode`] stays `Scalar` so retention
//! gates never count a fallback as vector coverage. Scalar/vector selection
//! never changes numeric results: vector-certified output is bit-exact
//! against scalar output for the same program.
//!
//! # Module map
//! - `module/` — scalar lowerer (decomposed `SignalToFirLower` sub-states).
//! - `delay/` — delay-line planner/manager/strategies (`-mcd`/`-dlt`).
//! - [`vector`] — checked vector pipeline; its `mod.rs` holds the
//!   authoritative producer/checker stage map.
//! - `block_reverse_ad`/`bra` — reverse-AD (`rad`) carriers: tape-free and
//!   taped backward sweeps with C++-compatible storage.
//! - [`decoration_verify`] — certified signal decorations consumed by the
//!   vector pipeline.
//! - [`pv_slice`], [`shadow`] — diagnostic/experimental surfaces (P2 vector
//!   pre-slice; schedule-conformance shadow reports).
//! - `loop_graph`, `placement`, `planner`, `cse`, `recursion`, `siggen`,
//!   `error` — internal analysis/lowering support.
//!
//! # Known unsupported behavior
//! Delays with unbounded runtime intervals, complex table-generator forms
//! depending on runtime context, and foreign functions inside `SIGGEN`
//! interpretation are rejected with typed `FRS-SFIR-*` errors. UI-program and
//! reverse-AD graphs under `-vec` fall back to scalar with stable reasons.
//!
//! # Crate boundary contract
//! - `transform` owns signal->FIR lowering entrypoints.
//! - `fir` owns FIR node model, builder, and matcher.
//! - `codegen` consumes resulting FIR modules.
//! - `compiler` chooses whether to route requests to this fast-lane.
//!
//! Development history (Step 2A–2H, P4–P6, RAD B3–B5 slices) lives in
//! `porting/` and the daily journal, not here.
