//! Variability-driven statement placement — Phase 1 analysis.
//!
//! This module contains the *pre-lowering analysis* that drives Phase 1 of the
//! FIR emission pipeline: deciding **where** (in which lifecycle section) each
//! signal node's FIR statement will be placed.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! Faust distinguishes three execution tiers based on how often a value can
//! change:
//!
//! | Tier | [`Variability`] | FIR section | C++ section |
//! |------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
//! | Init-time constant | [`Variability::Konst`] | `constants_statements` | `instanceConstants` |
//! | Block-rate control | [`Variability::Block`] | `control_statements` | `compute` preamble |
//! | Per-sample | [`Variability::Samp`] | `sample_statements` | `compute` inner loop |
//!
//! Phase 1 ensures that every FIR statement is emitted **exactly once, in the
//! correct section**, rather than being re-evaluated on every sample tick.
//!
//! # What this module provides
//!
//! [`analyze_signal_sharing`] performs a single DFS pre-pass over the signal
//! DAG before any lowering takes place.  It produces three maps that the lowering
//! engine ([`super::module::SignalToFirLower`]) stores and consults during
//! [`lower_sig`](super::module) dispatch:
//!
//! - **`ref_counts`**: how many parent nodes reference each [`SigId`].  A node
//!   with `ref_count >= 2` is *shared* and benefits from being materialized into
//!   a named variable (`fConst*` / `fSlow*`) so the expression is computed only
//!   once.
//! - **`has_higher_parent`**: nodes that sit at a *variability boundary* — i.e.
//!   at least one parent has strictly higher variability.  Even a single-use
//!   node at a boundary must be materialized, otherwise it would be inlined into
//!   its parent's (faster) execution tier and re-evaluated too frequently.
//! - **`konst_escapes`**: `Konst` nodes that feed a faster-tier parent
//!   (`Block`/`Samp`), plus `Konst` descendants of `BlockReverseAD` carriers.
//!   These cannot remain stack-local to `instanceConstants()` because their
//!   value is consumed later from `compute()` or from generated BRA reverse
//!   sweep code.
//!
//! ## Why `BlockReverseAD` constants are treated conservatively
//!
//! `BlockReverseAD` lowering does more than lower the original signal DAG. It
//! first emits the primal forward loop, then synthesizes a second program: the
//! reverse adjoint sweep in `compute()`. That synthesized sweep introduces uses
//! of forward subexpressions (for example SR-derived biquad coefficients from
//! `fi.resonbp`) that are not represented as ordinary parent edges in the
//! signal DAG analyzed here.
//!
//! A plain parent-variability analysis can therefore conclude that a shared
//! `Konst` subtree is used only inside `instanceConstants()` and materialize it
//! as a stack-local `fConst*`. If the BRA reverse sweep later reuses the same
//! lowered value in `compute()`, the FIR contains `LoadVar(Stack, "fConst*")`
//! outside the declaring function, and FIR verification reports an undeclared
//! variable.
//!
//! The local rule is intentionally conservative: every `Konst` descendant of a
//! `BlockReverseAD` carrier is considered escaping and is materialized as a DSP
//! struct field. This is not the minimal lifetime analysis, but it is robust for
//! the current lowering model because any such constant may be referenced by the
//! generated forward tape stores or reverse sweep. A more exact future design
//! would make the FIR cache lifecycle-aware per section (`instanceConstants`,
//! compute preamble, forward loop, reverse loop), but that would be a broader
//! change than this targeted safety boundary.
//!
//! [`Bucket`] is the runtime tag that identifies which section a hoisted
//! variable belongs to.
//!
//! [`is_trivial_fir`] is a predicate consulted by the placement gate inside
//! `lower_sig`: literals, variable loads, and null values are free to duplicate,
//! so they are never materialized into temporary variables.
//!
//! # Placement gate (inside `lower_sig`)
//!
//! The actual hoisting decision lives in `module.rs` as part of the main
//! `lower_sig` dispatch loop (it needs mutable access to the lowering engine's
//! internal statement lists and counters).  The gate combines the three
//! pieces provided here:
//!
//! ```text
//! if !is_trivial_fir(lowered)
//!    && !is_recursive_projection(sig)       // impl on SignalToFirLower
//!    && !matches!(sig, WrTbl(..))
//!    && (sig_shared || at_boundary)          // ref_counts / has_higher_parent
//! {
//!     match variability_of(sig) {            // impl on SignalToFirLower
//!         Konst => materialize_in_bucket(Constants, konst_escapes.contains(sig))
//!         Block => materialize_in_bucket(Control)
//!         _     => inline
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
