//! Read-only feasibility analysis for stateful reverse-mode AD.
//!
//! # Source provenance
//! Original Rust design for RAD phase E0, documented in
//! `porting/reverse-ad-rad-implementation-plan-2026-04-27-en.md` section
//! "19. Feasibility analysis for stateful RAD".
//!
//! # Scope
//! This module does not enable reverse-mode differentiation through
//! recursive or delayed signals. It classifies one recursive signal group so
//! future RAD phases can decide whether an exact stateful adjoint is
//! structurally plausible and which implementation family it would need.
//!
//! Current phase-1 `rad(...)` lowering still rejects temporal and recursive
//! signal families in `reverse_ad`. The functions here are used only as a
//! gate for diagnostics and as a preparatory predicate for later phases:
//!
//! - phase E1 can attempt a block-local transpose for groups classified as
//!   [`RadRecLinearity::LinearLti`];
//! - phase E2 can replay primal-block coefficients for groups classified as
//!   [`RadRecLinearity::LinearTimeVarying`];
//! - phase F must use finite-horizon back-propagation through time (BPTT) for
//!   groups classified as [`RadRecLinearity::Nonlinear`].
//!
//! # Input representation
//! The analysis runs on the De Bruijn recursion form produced during
//! propagation, before `signal_prepare` converts recursive placeholders into
//! symbolic `sigRec`/`sigProj` names:
//!
//! ```text
//! DEBRUIJNREC([branch_0, branch_1, ...])
//! DEBRUIJNREF(1)             // reference to the current recursion group
//! Proj(i, DEBRUIJNREF(1))    // recursive state lane i
//! ```
//!
//! The `current_level` value tracks nested De Bruijn scopes. A reference at
//! the current level is treated as dependence on the state being classified;
//! references to any other level are treated as independent time-varying
//! signals because they are outside the current recurrence's state vector.
//!
//! # Classification model
//! Each signal node is summarized by three facts:
//!
//! - whether it depends on a current-recursion state lane;
//! - the worst linearity class seen along any current-state path;
//! - whether the part independent of the current state is a literal constant
//!   or a time-varying signal.
//!
//! These facts let the local rule table distinguish `0.5 * state` from
//! `input(0) * state` and from `state * state`, without expanding the signal
//! graph into algebraic normal form.
//!
//! # Result classes
//! A successful recursive-group classification has the following meaning:
//!
//! - [`RadRecLinearity::LinearLti`] means every current-recursion back-edge
//!   appears linearly and only under constant coefficients. Independent input
//!   or UI driving terms are allowed because they do not change the linearity
//!   of the state transition.
//! - [`RadRecLinearity::LinearTimeVarying`] means the current back-edge is
//!   still linear, but at least one coefficient depends on a non-constant
//!   signal such as an input or UI control.
//! - [`RadRecLinearity::Nonlinear`] means a current back-edge flows through a
//!   nonlinear primitive, a branch, a discrete cast, or another expression
//!   that is not affine in the recursive variables.
//!
//! The lattice is monotonic: `Nonlinear` dominates
//! `LinearTimeVarying`, which dominates `LinearLti`. Multi-output recursive
//! groups are classified by taking that maximum across every branch.
//!
//! # Conservative boundaries
//! The analysis is intentionally conservative and read-only. Unsupported or
//! opaque signal families are treated as time-varying coefficients unless
//! they contain the current recursive reference in a recognized nonlinear
//! position.
//!
//! The classifier accepts temporal shifts such as `delay1(state)` as
//! structurally linear. That does not mean phase-1 RAD can lower them: the
//! reverse transpose of a delay is anti-causal in stream time and needs the
//! future block/tape convention described in the RAD plan.
//!
//! # Complexity
//! Classification is linear in the visited signal DAG for a fixed De Bruijn
//! level. `LinearityAnalyzer` memoizes `(SigId, current_level)` because the
//! same shared subgraph can be visited from several recursive branches and
//! because nested recursive groups change the meaning of a De Bruijn level.
