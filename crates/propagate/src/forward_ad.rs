//! Forward-mode automatic differentiation helpers for the `propagate` phase.
//!
//! # Source provenance (C++)
//! - `compiler/propagate/propagate.cpp`
//! - `compiler/transform/sigtyperules.hh`
//! - `compiler/signals/signals.cpp`
//!
//! # Scope
//! - Differentiate a list of primal outputs with respect to a list of seed
//!   signals supplied by the caller.
//! - Expand each primal output into `primal + one tangent per seed`.
//! - Preserve shared signal DAG structure through memoized transformation.
//! - Keep reverse-mode (`rad`) explicitly out of scope for this phase.
//!
//! # Current architecture
//! [`ForwardADTransform`] carries one tangent lane per selected seed inside
//! one internal dual-number carrier, and [`generate_fad_signals_multi`]
//! drives one transformer for the whole seed set. This keeps the
//! differentiation rules, recursion bookkeeping, and seed lifting expressed
//! once in the transformer and lets recursive groups share one interleaved
//! `DEBRUIJNREC` instead of rebuilding one private primal shadow per seed.
//!
//! Internally, one differentiated signal is represented as:
//!
//! ```text
//! Dual {
//!   primal,
//!   tangents = [d/ds0, d/ds1, …, d/ds{N-1}]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! where the seed order is exactly the order of the lowered seed outputs passed
//! by `fad(expr, seed_box)`.
//!
//! # Dual-number algebra
//! Forward-mode AD (FAD) propagates derivatives alongside values by carrying a
//! *tangent* component next to each signal. A **dual signal** is written
//! `u + ε·u'` where `ε² = 0`. A **seed** is any signal `s` chosen by the
//! caller; `ds/ds = 1` and every other independent input has seed `0`.
//!
//! A seed is not restricted to a UI control: it can be any `SigId` in the
//! signal DAG (a slider, a lambda-bound recursive input, an expression).
//! Seed recognition is pure `SigId` equality — the arena hash-conses every
//! node, so every external reference to the seed inside the primal body
//! shares the same `TreeId` as the seed argument and the equality check
//! fires at each occurrence. The transform short-circuits at that leaf and
//! never descends into the seed's own recursive body.
//!
//! Repeated seeds are preserved by lane index, not deduplicated semantically:
//! if the seed box lowers to `[s, s]`, the differentiated output bundle still
//! exposes two tangent lanes in that same order.
//!
//! When the seed expression carries free `DEBRUIJNREF` nodes, crossing a
//! `DEBRUIJNREC` scope shifts those references by one level. The transform
//! therefore lifts every active seed on entry into each REC body (and
//! restores the previous seed vector on exit) so `SigId` equality keeps
//! matching under the new scope.
//!
//! The transform maintains two internal seed views:
//!
//! - `diff_seeds: Vec<SigId>` preserves deterministic lane order,
//! - `diff_seed_index: AHashMap<SigId, SmallVec<[usize; 2]>>` provides the
//!   reverse lookup from one `SigId` to one or more tangent lanes.
//!
//! This keeps seed recognition explicit while avoiding a linear scan over the
//! seed list at every visited node.
//!
//! # Differentiation rules by node kind
//!
//! ## Constants and audio inputs
//!
//! | Node | Tangent |
//! |------|---------|
//! | `int(c)` | `0` |
//! | `real(c)` | `0.0` |
//! | `sigInput(_)` | `0.0` |
//!
//! Audio inputs are treated as independent of all UI controls.
//!
//! ## Seeds and UI controls
//!
//! Seed equality is checked *before* node-kind dispatch, so any node whose
//! `SigId` equals a selected seed returns `1.0` on the matching tangent lane
//! and `0.0` on every other lane.
//!
//! | Node | Tangent |
//! |------|---------|
//! | any signal `s` such that `s == seed_j` | lane `j` = `1.0`, every other lane = `0.0` |
//! | `hslider` / `vslider` / `numentry` (not a seed) | `0.0` |
//! | `button`, `checkbox` | `0.0` (discrete, not differentiable) |
//!
//! Under the explicit-seed model, `[autodiff:false]` metadata is ignored:
//! whether a signal is differentiated is decided by the caller's seed list,
//! not by per-control annotations. The metadata still parses without error
//! so legacy sources remain accepted.
//!
//! The zero-tangent treatment for controls is intentional and not just a
//! parser limitation:
//!
//! - `hslider` / `vslider` / `numentry` are ordinary continuous signals when
//!   they are selected as explicit seeds; otherwise they are treated as
//!   independent of the active differentiation variables;
//! - `button` / `checkbox` are discrete state/control sources, so the current
//!   FAD pass models them as piecewise-constant and returns zero tangents;
//! - `vbargraph` / `hbargraph` are metering sinks, not differentiated signal
//!   paths.
//!
//! ## Arithmetic binary operators (`BinOp`)
//!
//! | Operator | Tangent rule |
//! |----------|-------------|
//! | `x + y` | `x' + y'` |
//! | `x - y` | `x' - y'` |
//! | `x * y` | `x'·y + x·y'` (product rule) |
//! | `x / y` | `(x'·y − x·y') / y²` (quotient rule) |
//! | `x % y` | `x' − y'·⌊x/y⌋` |
//! | shifts, bitwise ops, comparisons | `0` (non-differentiable integer ops) |
//!
//! ## Unary transcendentals (chain rule: `d f(x)/dp = f'(x) · x'`)
//!
//! | Function | Derivative `f'(x)` | Tangent emitted |
//! |----------|--------------------|-----------------|
//! | `sin(x)` | `cos(x)` | `cos(x) * x'` |
//! | `cos(x)` | `−sin(x)` | `(0 - sin(x)) * x'` |
//! | `tan(x)` | `1 / cos²(x)` | `(1 / cos(x)²) * x'` |
//! | `exp(x)` | `exp(x)` | `exp(x) * x'` |
//! | `log(x)` | `1 / x` | `(1 / x) * x'` |
//! | `log10(x)` | `1 / (x · ln 10)` | `(1 / (x * log(10))) * x'` |
//! | `sqrt(x)` | `1 / (2 · √x)` | `(1 / (2 * sqrt(x))) * x'` |
//! | `abs(x)` | `x / |x|` (sign) | `(x / abs(x)) * x'` |
//! | `acos(x)` | `−1 / √(1 − x²)` | `(-1 / sqrt(1 - x²)) * x'` |
//! | `asin(x)` | `1 / √(1 − x²)` | `(1 / sqrt(1 - x²)) * x'` |
//! | `atan(x)` | `1 / (1 + x²)` | `(1 / (1 + x²)) * x'` |
//!
//! Note: `abs` is not differentiable at `x = 0`; the expression `x/|x|`
//! has undefined behaviour there and produces `NaN` or `±inf` at runtime.
//!
//! ## Binary math (`pow`, `min`, `max`)
//!
//! ### `pow(x, y)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp x^y = x^y · (y' · ln(x) + y · x' / x)
//! ```
//! Both `x` and `y` may depend on the active seeds. The primal term `x^y` and
//! the common scalar factors are hoisted once, then one tangent lane is emitted
//! per seed.
//!
//! ### `min(x, y)` / `max(x, y)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp min(x,y) = select2(x < y, x', y')
//! d/dp max(x,y) = select2(x > y, x', y')
//! ```
//! The selector comes from the primal comparison. The tangent is piecewise
//! constant and uses the chosen branch's tangent lane.
//!
//! ### `atan2(y, x)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp atan2(y, x) = (x·y' − y·x') / (x² + y²)
//! ```
//!
//! ### `fmod(x, y)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp fmod(x, y) = x' − y'·floor(x/y)
//! ```
//!
//! ### `remainder(x, y)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp remainder(x, y) = x' − y'·round(x/y)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Foreign functions (`FFun`)
//!
//! Foreign functions are matched by name against a known-differentiable set.
//! The FFUN descriptor carries one name per precision variant; all slots are
//! checked so the match is precision-agnostic (`tanhf` / `tanh` / `tanhl`
//! all identify the same mathematical operation).
//!
//! Recognized unary rules:
//!
//! | Function | Names (`f32` \| `f64` \| `ldbl`) | Tangent rule | Notes |
//! |----------|----------------------------------|--------------|-------|
//! | `tanh(x)` | `tanhf` / `tanh` / `tanhl` | `x' · (1 − tanh²(x))` | computed from primal |
//! | `sinh(x)` | `sinhf` / `sinh` / `sinhl` | `x' · cosh(x)` | `cosh(x)` rebuilt as `sqrt(1 + sinh²(x))` |
//! | `cosh(x)` | `coshf` / `cosh` / `coshl` | `x' · sinh(x)` | `sinh(x)` rebuilt from exponentials |
//! | `atanh(x)` | `atanhf` / `atanh` / `atanhl` | `x' / (1 − x²)` | |
//! | `asinh(x)` | `asinhf` / `asinh` / `asinhl` | `x' / sqrt(1 + x²)` | |
//! | `acosh(x)` | `acoshf` / `acosh` / `acoshl` | `x' / sqrt(x² − 1)` | |
//!
//! Unrecognized FFUN calls, non-unary FFUNs, table writes, soundfile
//! accessors, standalone waveforms, on-demand up/downsampling, `Gen`,
//! `PermVar`, `TempVar`, and every other unmatched signal variant fall
//! through to a zero tangent with the primal unchanged.
//!
//! ## Cast operators
//!
//! | Node | Tangent |
//! |------|---------|
//! | `float_cast(x)` | `float_cast(x')` |
//! | `int_cast(x)` | `0` (piecewise-constant step function) |
//! | `bit_cast(x)` | `0` (reinterpret-cast, semantically opaque) |
//!
//! These choices are deliberate approximation boundaries:
//!
//! - `float_cast` preserves the underlying numeric value and therefore forwards
//!   the tangent through the cast;
//! - `int_cast` introduces discontinuous truncation/rounding semantics, so the
//!   derivative is treated as zero rather than trying to model impulses at
//!   integer boundaries;
//! - `bit_cast` changes representation rather than mathematical value and is
//!   therefore outside the differentiable subset.
//!
//! ## Delay operators
//!
//! ### Unit delay `delay1(x)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp delay1(x) = delay1(x')
//! ```
//!
//! ### Variable delay `delay(x, d)`
//! ```text
//! d/dp x[n − d(n)] = x'[n − d(n)]
//!                  − d'(n) · ∇x[n − d(n)]
//! ```
//! where `∇x[n−d]` is approximated as `delay(x − delay1(x), d)`.
//!
//! ## Read-only table reads
//!
//! `SIGRDTBL(table, idx)` is differentiable when `table` is a read-only table
//! source:
//!
//! - `SIGWAVEFORM(...)`
//! - `SIGWRTBL(size, generator, nil, nil)` produced by read-only table forms
//!
//! The table payload is treated as constant data. FAD differentiates only
//! through the read address:
//!
//! ```text
//! y = rdtbl(T, i)
//! y' = dT/di(i) · i'
//! dT/di(i) ≈ (rdtbl(T, i + 1) - rdtbl(T, i - 1)) / 2
//! ```
//!
//! This is a deliberate Rust-side approximation model, not a claim of exact
//! source-level parity with the Faust C++ compiler.
//!
//! Important boundaries:
//!
//! - the read uses the existing runtime table semantics for bounds handling;
//!   FAD does not invent extra wrap/clamp rules around `i ± 1`
//! - table contents are not differentiated
//! - writable tables stay outside the differentiable subset and emit zero
//!   tangents even when wrapped in `SIGRDTBL`
//!
//! ## Control-flow nodes
//!
//! | Node | Tangent |
//! |------|---------|
//! | `select2(cond, x, y)` | `select2(cond, x', y')` |
//! | `prefix(init, x)` | `prefix(init', x')` |
//!
//! ## Projection and recursive groups (de Bruijn form)
//!
//! `propagate` always emits recursive groups in de Bruijn form
//! (`DEBRUIJNREC` / `DEBRUIJNREF` tag nodes). The transform never sees
//! symbolic form (`SYMREC` / `SYMREF`); `de_bruijn_to_sym` runs once in
//! `signal_prepare` *after* FAD, over all process outputs together.
//!
//! ### Rewrite rules (N seed lanes)
//!
//! | Expression | Rewrite |
//! |------------|---------|
//! | `rec([e₀, …, eₖ₋₁])` | `rec([e₀, e₀'_{s₀}, …, e₀'_{sₙ₋₁}, e₁, e₁'_{s₀}, …, eₖ₋₁, eₖ₋₁'_{sₙ₋₁}])` — body interleaved as `[primal, tangent₀, …, tangentₙ₋₁]` per slot |
//! | `proj(i, rec_rebuilt)` | primal: `proj(i·(1+N), …)` ; tangent lane j: `proj(i·(1+N)+1+j, …)` |
//! | `proj(i, ref(k ≤ depth))` | same slot remapping as above (ref points into an already-rebuilt group on this path) |
//! | `proj(i, ref(k > depth))` | primal: `proj(i, …)` (pass-through) ; every tangent lane: `0` (outer group not rewritten on this path) |
//!
//! FAD's index bookkeeping rests on three distinct notions:
//!
//! - **Level** (payload on `DEBRUIJNREF`): a static integer `k` meaning
//!   "the `k`-th enclosing `DEBRUIJNREC`, innermost = 1".
//! - **`debruijn_depth`** (traversal counter on [`ForwardADTransform`]):
//!   incremented only when FAD enters a `DEBRUIJNREC` body that it rewrites.
//! - **Slot index** (integer on a `Proj` node): selects one element from
//!   a REC body.
//!
//! For a transformer carrying `N` seed lanes, every differentiated recursion
//! body is interleaved as:
//!
//! ```text
//! [p0, t0_s0, t0_s1, …, p1, t1_s0, t1_s1, …]
//! ```
//!
//! so the original slot `i` maps to:
//!
//! - primal slot `i * (1 + N)`
//! - tangent slot `i * (1 + N) + 1 + seed_index`
//!
//! The projection arm classifies the group into three semantic cases:
//!
//! | Group | Meaning | Primal projection | Tangent projection |
//! |-------|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
//! | `DEBRUIJNREC` directly | the current transform just rebuilt this recursion | `proj(i * (1 + N), …)` | `proj(i * (1 + N) + 1 + lane, …)` |
//! | `DEBRUIJNREF(level <= debruijn_depth)` | points into a recursion already rewritten on this path | same as above | same as above |
//! | `DEBRUIJNREF(level > debruijn_depth)` | points to an enclosing recursion that this transform never entered | `proj(i, …)` | `0` on every lane |
//! | Other | defensive fallback outside the expected de Bruijn-only flow | `proj(i, …)` | `proj(i, …)` lane-wise |
//!
//! The `level > debruijn_depth` case is the subtle one. It means the current
//! transform is differentiating inside an inner recursion, but the projection
//! points to an outer recursion group whose body has not been rewritten by this
//! transformer instance on the current descent path. In that situation the
//! outer group keeps its original slot numbering, so the primal projection is
//! forwarded unchanged and the tangent lanes are forced to zero.
//!
//! Conceptually:
//!
//! ```text
//! outer = rec([...])
//! inner = rec([ ..., proj(slot_i, ref(level = 2)), ... ])
//! ```
//!
//! While differentiating `inner`, `proj(slot_i, ref(level = 2))` still means
//! "read the already-existing primal slot `slot_i` from `outer`". No
//! differentiated `(1 + N)` expansion is available there unless the transform
//! has also entered and rebuilt `outer` on this path.
//!
//! A placeholder is inserted into the cache before descending into the REC body
//! so back-edges can resolve while the final interleaved node is still being
//! rebuilt. The placeholder is strictly internal to that recursive descent.
//! It is never an externally visible semantic result:
//!
//! - it breaks the cycle while recursive slots are being interned,
//! - it is replaced by the finished interleaved `DEBRUIJNREC` before the
//!   recursive descent returns,
//! - every public output projects from the rebuilt recursion, not the
//!   placeholder shape.
//!
//! The `de_bruijn_to_sym` conversion is deferred to `signal_prepare`, where it
//! runs once over all process outputs through one `Converter` instance. This
//! guarantees that the same `DEBRUIJNREC` physical node maps to the same
//! `SYMREC` name in every primal and tangent lane.
//!
//! ## Pass-through helper nodes (`attach`, `enable`, `control`, `Output`)
//!
//! These carry a left (signal) and right (side-effect/control) operand. Only
//! the left operand's tangent is forwarded; the right operand is structurally
//! preserved with its tangent dropped. `Output` is similarly transparent and
//! differentiates only the wrapped signal.
//!
//! ## Bargraph outputs (`vbargraph`, `hbargraph`)
//!
//! Zero tangent for both. Bargraphs are metering outputs, not DSP signal paths.
//!
//! # Zero-tangent fallback boundary
//! Several signal families are intentionally outside the current
//! differentiable subset and therefore preserve the primal while emitting zero
//! tangents on every lane.
//!
//! | Family | Current treatment | Rationale |
//! |--------|-------------------|-----------|
//! | integer comparisons / bitwise / shifts | zero tangent | discrete integer semantics |
//! | `button`, `checkbox` | zero tangent | event-like / piecewise-constant control |
//! | `int_cast`, `bit_cast` | zero tangent | discontinuous or representation-level operation |
//! | unknown `FFun` / non-unary `FFun` | zero tangent | no trusted derivative rule in this pass |
//! | writable-table reads/writes, soundfiles, standalone waveforms, `Gen`, `PermVar`, `TempVar` | zero tangent | mutable or not yet modeled as differentiable primitives |
//! | unmatched / defensive fallback variants | zero tangent | preserve compilation robustness while keeping the primal |
//!
//! This is a support boundary, not a claim that the mathematical derivative is
//! literally zero in all cases. The invariant of the pass is narrower: when a
//! signal family has no explicit forward rule, compilation stays defined and
//! the primal is preserved instead of fabricating an unverified tangent.
//!
//! # Integration contract
//! This module is intentionally internal to `propagate`:
//! - `box_arity_typed(...)` reports expanded output arity for `fad(expr, seeds…)`,
//! - output expansion happens only after the wrapped box has already lowered to
//!   signal IR,
//! - seeds are user-supplied through `fad(expr, seed)`; the seed
//!   sub-expression is lowered to signals like any other box and its outputs
//!   become the seed list. `[autodiff:false]` metadata is not consulted.
//!
//! # Ordering invariant
//! Tangent outputs are emitted deterministically:
//! 1. preserve primal output order,
//! 2. for each primal, emit one tangent per seed in the seed list's order.
//!
//! # Recursive code generation note
//! The unified multi-seed transform reuses the primal slot already present in
//! the differentiated recursive group. For recursive programs this removes the
//! previous "one AD-local primal shadow recursion per seed" pattern and makes
//! primal/tangent outputs project into the same interleaved `DEBRUIJNREC`.
//!
//! For example, the single-seed program
//!
//! ```text
//! process = fad((2 : + ~ *(p)), p);
//! ```
//!
//! now lowers conceptually to one recursive group:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ y[n] = p * y[n-1] + 2,
//!   dy/dp[n] = y[n-1] + p * dy/dp[n-1] ]
//! ```
//!
//! instead of:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ original primal recursion ] + [ duplicated AD-local primal recursion + tangent ]
//! ```
//!
//! The result is the same DSP semantics with less duplicated recursive state in
//! the emitted code.
