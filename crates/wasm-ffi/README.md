# wasm-ffi

Raw WASM export surface for the Rust-backed `faustwasm` embedded-compiler path.

## Role

`wasm-ffi` is the thin binding crate that sits on top of the pure Rust compile
service in [`compiler`](../compiler/). It is intended to be compiled as a
standalone `wasm32-unknown-unknown` module and loaded from `faustwasm`.

The exported ABI is intentionally small:

- one compile request in
- one owned result handle out
- raw pointer/length accessors for `{ wasm, json, compile_options }`
- helper text-result calls for `getInfos(...)` and the current explicit stubs

## Build the compiler module

From the workspace root:

```bash
$HOME/.cargo/bin/rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
$HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo run -p xtask -- build-faustwasm-compiler-module
```

This command:

- builds `wasm-ffi` for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- verifies that the emitted module exports the raw ABI expected by the
  `faustwasm` Rust adapter
- prints the output path under `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`

Use `--debug` to build the non-release artifact:

```bash
$HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo run -p xtask -- build-faustwasm-compiler-module --debug
```

If you want to force a specific standard-library root into the embedded bundle:

```bash
FAUST_RS_EMBEDDED_LIB_ROOT=/path/to/faust/libraries \
  $HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo run -p xtask -- build-faustwasm-compiler-module
```

If a `faustwasm` source string depends on project-local `.lib` files, embed
both the local root and the standard-library root through `FAUST_LIB_PATH`:

```bash
FAUST_LIB_PATH=/path/to/project:/path/to/faust/libraries \
  $HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo run -p xtask -- build-faustwasm-compiler-module
```

The default release artifact is:

```text
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/faust_wasm_ffi.wasm
```

## Raw ABI usage

The raw compiler-module ABI is explicitly handle-based:

1. allocate host-written UTF-8 buffers with `faust_wasm_alloc`
2. write `name`, `source`, and `args` bytes into those buffers
3. call `faust_wasm_compile_dsp`
4. inspect the returned handle with `faust_wasm_result_is_ok`
5. read payloads through:
   - `faust_wasm_result_wasm_ptr/len`
   - `faust_wasm_result_json_ptr/len`
   - `faust_wasm_result_compile_options_ptr/len`
   - or `faust_wasm_result_error_ptr/len`
6. copy the payloads on the host side
7. release the compile result with `faust_wasm_result_free`
8. release the temporary request buffers with `faust_wasm_dealloc`

Pointer validity rules:

- payload pointers returned by `faust_wasm_result_*_ptr` stay valid only until
  the matching `faust_wasm_result_free(handle)`
- request buffers returned by `faust_wasm_alloc` stay valid only until the
  matching `faust_wasm_dealloc(ptr, len)`
- handles are process-global within one compiler-module instance and are not
  stable across module reinstantiation

Concurrency note:

- the module uses process-global mutex-protected registries for compile and
  helper results
- concurrent host calls are safe at the registry level, but the public contract
  is still “copy returned bytes promptly, then free the handle”

## Embedded Faust libraries

At build time, `wasm-ffi` can discover and embed a read-only bundle of Faust
`.lib` sources directly into the compiler-module. The current root discovery
order is:

- valid roots from `FAUST_RS_EMBEDDED_LIB_ROOT`
- valid roots from `FAUST_RS_FAUSTLIBRARIES_ROOT`
- all valid entries from `FAUST_LIB_PATH`
- `/usr/local/share/faust`
- `/usr/share/faust`

When several roots are embedded, logical `.lib` paths are merged in search
order and the first root providing a given logical path wins. This lets a
project-local root add files such as `ad.lib` while the next root still supplies
`stdfaust.lib` and the standard Faust libraries.

If none of these roots exist at build time, the compiler-module still builds,
but without an embedded standard-library bundle. In that case, source-string
compilation that depends on `import("stdfaust.lib")` will fail unless the host
provides equivalent imports through another path.

The embedded bundle is used for the Rust raw compiler path only. It allows:

- parser-side `import("stdfaust.lib")` from an in-memory DSP source
- evaluator-side `library("...")` / `component("...")` resolution against the
  same bundled logical sources

This keeps the `faustwasm` compiler-module self-contained for the standard
Faust libraries without recreating an Emscripten-style virtual filesystem.

Import precedence:

- user-supplied `-I` search paths are still parsed and forwarded into the typed
  compile request
- the embedded bundle provides the logical standard-library files directly to
  the parser/evaluator for source-string compilation
- `library_list` in the returned JSON reports the logical imported file names
  seen during compilation, not an Emscripten-style resolved filesystem path

## Current scope

| Surface | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| `compile_dsp` | implemented |
| `getInfos("version")` | implemented |
| `getInfos("help")` | implemented |
| `getInfos("libdir"\\|"includedir"\\|"archdir"\\|"dspdir"\\|"pathslist")` | supported; mirrors C++ Faust directory-info queries |
| `expandDSP(...)` | API present, currently returns the Rust service result when implemented for the requested shape, otherwise `unsupported` |
| `generateAuxFiles(...)` | API present for `-cpp`, `-c`, `-wasm`, `-json`, and `-svg`; SVG artifacts are generated in memory through `draw::draw_schema_to_memory` |

That `.wasm` file is the compiler-module artifact that the `faustwasm`
embedded-compiler path is expected to load.
