//! Faust-syntax serialization of box trees.
//!
//! # Source provenance (C++)
//! - `compiler/boxes/ppbox.hh`
//! - `compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp`
//! - `boxpp::print(std::ostream&)` and `boxppShared::print(std::ostream&)`
//!
//! # Public API mapping status
//! `adapted`. The emitted text is the parity target; the implementation
//! differs from C++ in three deliberate ways, each documented at its site:
//! no process-global printer state, an explicit worklist instead of recursion,
//! and `Result` instead of exceptions.
//!
//! # The two printers
//! [`box_pp`] expands a box into one self-contained expression. A box tree is
//! a DAG after evaluation, so this expansion is worst-case exponential in the
//! node count; it exists for small sub-expressions and for the two node kinds
//! that cannot be shared (see below).
//!
//! [`box_pp_shared`] is the printer behind the `-e` option. Every composite
//! node is assigned an `ID_<n>` and emitted once as a top-level definition, so
//! output size is linear in the DAG size. Definitions are emitted in
//! first-completion order, which guarantees every `ID_<n>` is defined before
//! its first use and makes the result a valid Faust definition list.
//!
//! # Why abstractions are never shared
//! `Abstr` (`\x.(body)`) and `Symbolic` (`\(slot).(body)`) bind a variable
//! inside their body. Hoisting a sub-expression of that body into a top-level
//! `ID_<n> = ...;` definition would move an occurrence of the bound variable
//! out of its binder's scope, turning it free and changing the program's
//! meaning. Both node kinds therefore render their bodies through [`box_pp`],
//! matching `compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp:550,717`.
//!
//! # Operator parenthesization
//! Composition operators carry a priority (`:` and `<:`/`:>` = 1, `,` = 2,
//! `~` = 4). A binary node is parenthesized when the priority of the context
//! it appears in exceeds its own — `streambinop`/`streambinopShared`,
//! `compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp:174,187`. Under sharing, the priority observed at
//! a node's *first* visit is the one baked into its memoized definition text;
//! later uses print `ID_<n>`, which never needs parentheses. This is why the
//! same sub-diagram can appear as `ID_1 = (ID_0 : *)` in one program and
//! `ID_1 = ID_0 : *` in another.
