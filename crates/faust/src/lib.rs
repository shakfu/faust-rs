//! The Rust API of faust-rs: compile a Faust program to a [`Factory`],
//! instantiate it as [`Dsp`] values, set their parameters and run them.
//!
//! This crate is the supported way to embed faust-rs from Rust. The other
//! crates of the workspace (`compiler`, `codegen`, `interp-ffi`,
//! `cranelift-ffi`, ...) are implementation details with no stability
//! promise; the C API of `libfaust-rs` and this crate are the two contracts.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! One model for the two backends, the bytecode interpreter and the Cranelift
//! JIT, chosen by [`CompileOptions::backend`]:
//!
//! - a [`Factory`] is a compiled program: its arities, its JSON description,
//!   and the code (bytecode or machine code) every instance runs. Factories
//!   are cheap to clone; a clone is another handle on the same compiled
//!   program;
//! - a [`Dsp`] is an instance: its state, its sample rate, its parameters.
//!   [`Factory::create_dsp_instance`] creates and initialises one. A `Dsp` owns a
//!   reference to its factory, so the factory's code lives as long as any of
//!   its instances, whatever the host does with its own `Factory` handles.
//!   No lifetime parameter, no `unsafe` for the host: a `Dsp` is a plain
//!   value that can be stored, moved, sent to another thread and shared
//!   (`Send + Sync`: its `&self` methods only read);
//! - parameters are addressed as the C++ `MapUI` addresses them: by path
//!   (`/group/label`, the OSC address), by shortname or by label;
//!   [`Dsp::set_param_value`] and [`Dsp::get_param_value`] write and read
//!   them, and [`Dsp::params`] lists them with their names, kind and range.
//!
//! # Precision
//!
//! [`CompileOptions::args`] selects `-double` or `-single`; without either, the
//! program computes in single precision. [`Factory::precision`] reports the
//! backend's compiled width, which [`Dsp::compute`] uses for host buffers
//! and UI parameter zones.
//! [`Dsp::compute`] accepts host buffers of either width, `f32` or `f64`
//! (see [`Sample`]), and converts when it differs from the compiled
//! precision, which is what both backends exchange: a `-double` program run
//! over `f64` buffers sees its samples unrounded on either backend. (The
//! interpreter's C ABI exchanges `f32` whatever the precision; this crate
//! reaches its `f64` path through a Rust entry point of `interp-ffi`.)
//!
//! # Names
//!
//! The methods that have a counterpart in the C++ `dsp` and `dsp_factory`
//! classes (`architecture/faust/dsp/dsp.h`), or in the `MapUI` class a C++
//! host drives the parameters with (`architecture/faust/gui/MapUI.h`), carry
//! its name in snake case, as the `FaustDsp` trait of the Rust architectures
//! does:
//!
//! | C++ | this crate |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `getNumInputs`, `getNumOutputs`, `getSampleRate` | [`Dsp::get_num_inputs`], [`Dsp::get_num_outputs`], [`Dsp::get_sample_rate`] |
//! | `init`, `instanceInit`, `instanceConstants` | [`Dsp::init`], [`Dsp::instance_init`], [`Dsp::instance_constants`] |
//! | `instanceResetUserInterface`, `instanceClear` | [`Dsp::instance_reset_user_interface`], [`Dsp::instance_clear`] |
//! | `metadata(Meta*)` | [`Dsp::metadata`], which returns the pairs |
//! | `compute(count, inputs, outputs)` | [`Dsp::compute`], generic over [`Sample`] as `FAUSTFLOAT` |
//! | `dsp_factory::getName`, `getJSON` | [`Factory::get_name`], [`Factory::get_json`] |
//! | `dsp_factory::createDSPInstance` | [`Factory::create_dsp_instance`], which also initialises |
//! | `MapUI::setParamValue`, `getParamValue` | [`Dsp::set_param_value`], [`Dsp::get_param_value`]: by path, shortname or label, in that order |
//! | `MapUI` paths, shortnames and labels | [`Param::path`], [`Param::shortname`], [`Param::label`] |
//!
//! `buildUserInterface` has no counterpart: [`Dsp::params`] and the
//! `MapUI`-like methods above replace the `UI` a host would implement. Nor has
//! `clone`, whose C++ semantics (a fresh instance of the same factory) a Rust
//! `clone` would misname: `dsp.factory().create_dsp_instance(rate)` is it.
//! What has no counterpart in C++ (the backend, the precision, the list of
//! the parameters) is named the Rust way.
//!
//! # Known gap
//!
//! [`Dsp::metadata`] returns what the backend's `metadata` entry point
//! declares. The C++ and other text backends receive the program's
//! `declare` lines from the compiler, but the FIR the interpreter and the
//! Cranelift backend consume carries an empty `metadata` function, so for
//! them only the backend's own entries appear (the C API has the same gap).
//! The name and the parameter metadata (`[unit:dB]`...) are not affected.
//!
//! # Lifecycle behind the scenes
//!
//! Both backends are driven through their C entry points, so a `Factory` has
//! exactly the semantics of the C API: compiled programs are shared by SHA
//! key and reference counted, and a `Dsp` holds one reference to its
//! factory's entry. All the `unsafe` lives in this crate.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use faust::{Backend, CompileOptions, Factory};
//!
//! let options = CompileOptions { backend: Backend::Cranelift, ..Default::default() };
//! let factory = Factory::from_source("gain", r#"process = _ * hslider("gain", 0.5, 0, 1, 0.01);"#, &options)?;
//! let mut dsp = factory.create_dsp_instance(48_000)?;
//! dsp.set_param_value("gain", 0.25)?; // a path, a shortname or a label
//! let input = [1.0_f32; 64];
//! let mut output = [0.0_f32; 64];
//! dsp.compute(64, &[&input], &mut [&mut output])?;
//! assert_eq!(output[0], 0.25);
//! # Ok::<(), faust::Error>(())
//! ```
