//! Contract checker: textual backends name their DSP `mydsp` by default and
//! honor `-cn` / `--class-name`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The rule was convention rather than contract, and two backends had drifted
//! from it independently: `-lang asc` derived the name from the source file
//! stem, and `-lang interp` built its options with a hardcoded default so the
//! flag was silently ignored. Both were found by hand. This checker turns the
//! convention into something a new backend cannot quietly break.
//!
//! # Why it covers backends that do not exist yet
//!
//! The backend list is not written down here. It is read from the CLI's own
//! `--lang` possible-values list, so a backend added to `CliLang` is picked up
//! with no edit to this file.
//!
//! Applicability is self-selecting rather than an exclusion list to maintain:
//! a backend is subject to the contract when *either* half of it is
//! observable: the default output says `mydsp`, or the requested name shows up
//! under `--class-name`. Both halves are needed, and each was validated by a
//! mutation. Keying on the default alone would let the pre-fix `asc` backend —
//! which named the DSP after the source file — skip the check; keying on the
//! echo alone lets a backend that *ignores* the flag skip it, which is exactly
//! how the `interp` defect stayed invisible on the first draft of this file.
//! "The flag changes the output at all" was also tried and rejected: it
//! false-positives on the Cranelift report, whose JIT entry address differs
//! between runs. Formats carrying no DSP name
//! — the FIR dump, WAT text, the Cranelift report, the WASM binary — never
//! echo the requested name and opt out by construction, as a future one
//! would.
