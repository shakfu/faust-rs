//! Unified C/C++ FFI distribution crate.
//!
//! This crate owns the canonical `libfaust` artifacts (`staticlib` + `cdylib`).
//! Backend-specific FFI crates (`interp-ffi`, `cranelift-ffi`, `box-ffi`,
//! `signal-ffi`) are linked as Rust libraries and their exported `extern "C"`
//! symbols are distributed through this single top-level library.
