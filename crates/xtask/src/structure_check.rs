//! Lightweight structural checks for the crates this readability campaign
//! restructured (plan `porting/faust-rs-structure-readability-plan-2026-08-18-{en,fr}.md`,
//! phases P1–P5), plus the vector producer/checker rules from cleanup plan R9.3.
//!
//! Deterministic, filesystem-only checks (findings sorted, repo-relative
//! paths only — never absolute paths):
//!
//! 1. no stale legacy internal `vector_*` import paths (R3 migrated the
//!    workspace to `signal_fir::vector::{...}`; the `pub use` facade
//!    re-exports in `signal_fir/mod.rs` are the only allowed mention);
//! 2. no production file above the review threshold in `crates/transform`,
//!    `crates/compiler`, `crates/fir`, or `crates/codegen`
//!    ([`MAX_PRODUCTION_LINES`] lines, `tests.rs` and `tests/` excluded)
//!    unless the file is named in [`KNOWN_OVERSIZED_FILES`] with a reason.
//!    That list is cross-checked both ways: every entry must name a file that
//!    actually exists and is actually over the threshold, so an exception a
//!    later split has resolved gets flagged for removal instead of lingering;
//! 3. no checker file importing a producer entry point (the producer entry
//!    points listed in [`PRODUCER_ENTRY_POINTS`] must never be callable
//!    from a `check`/`verify` module), and [`PRODUCER_ENTRY_POINTS`] itself
//!    is cross-checked against the `pub fn`s actually present in the
//!    producer files so a renamed or newly added entry point cannot
//!    silently rot the list;
//! 4. no `check.rs` importing *anything* from a sibling producer file
//!    (`build`/`produce`/`materialize`/`session`): since the clock_ad
//!    checker-independence follow-up (2026-07-20), every vector checker
//!    re-derives with its own code, and the allowlist
//!    [`CHECKER_PRODUCER_IMPORT_ALLOWLIST`] is empty by design — a new
//!    entry is an architecture regression, not a freeze candidate;
//! 5. every crate in [`DOCUMENTED_CRATES`] declares `#![deny(missing_docs)]`
//!    verbatim in its `lib.rs`. `deny` is required, not `warn`: an inner
//!    `#![warn(missing_docs)]` attribute overrides the command-line
//!    `-D warnings` that clippy and CI already pass, so a `warn` there is
//!    invisible to every existing gate — exactly the shape of a documented
//!    guarantee (`transform`'s plan R9.2, `compiler`'s own doc comment) that
//!    was never actually enforced until this was caught with a rejecting
//!    mutation on 2026-08-18. `deny` needs no separate command: it fails
//!    `cargo build`/`check`/`clippy`/`test` directly for that crate.
